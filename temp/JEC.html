          through the admission process as the serial number, and is used to

          <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Component</strong> - the next 3 numbers
          indicate the student&rsquo;s unique number (based on alphabetical order of
          surnames of fresh students at the centre);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3<sup>rd</sup> Component</strong> - and the last two numbers
          indicate the student&rsquo;s original expected year of completion.

          <strong>Note:</strong> The Exam Number is made up of all the 3

      21.1 ASSESSMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The policy document on the Diploma in Basic Education Programme
      recommends that the assessment of students should be based on 40 %
      Continuous Assessment (C.A.) and 60 % End-of-Semester Examinations. The
      type of C.A. envisaged is the &lsquo;continuous in-course teacher assessment&rsquo;
      where tutors will play a major role in C.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UEW shall monitor and moderate the questions and scoring procedures
      of the College.
    </p>
    <h2 id="continuous-assessment-c.a.">
      21.2 CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT (C.A.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Centre will handle the C.A. component of the assessment but will be
      guided by the following as the number of assessments to be recorded in a
      course for each semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each 3 credit course: 1 assignment (10 marks) + 1 mid-semester
      examination (20 marks) + attendance (10 marks)

      21.3 END-OF-SEMESTER EXAMINATIONS

    <p>
      A semester comprises sixteen weeks. The End-of-Semester Examinations will
      be conducted at the various centres by the College, moderated by the
      University of Education, Winneba, in line with the Semester Course Unit
      System (SCUS) of the UEW. The fourteenth week will be used as a revision
      week whilst the last two weeks will be used for the End-of-Semester
      Examinations.

    <p>

        <p>
          Section 28.1 and 28.2 set out the code of conduct for every JCE
          student. This code, which is in line with the GES code, has spelt out
          in detail and indicates the code of conduct expected of every student
          in the College.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The code of discipline is based on the principle that punishment is
          to reform. However, the punishment shall be severe enough to act as a
          deterrent to others.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The purpose of this code is not to prescribe punishment for every
          offence committed but to provide a guide on the disciplinary measures
          that may deter students from committing offences, and compel them to
          exercise self-control and self-discipline in their day-to-day
          activities. It may also serve as a guide to limits of sanctions,
          bearing in mind the humane approach authorities are expected to adopt
          in all matters relating to discipline in the College.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There shall be a platform to set up committees with students&rsquo;
          representation on them to deal with all aspects of school life. It is
          hoped that, student leadership and other School Committees will help
          to maintain the desired discipline in the Institution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Principal, Co-ordinators and Supervisors shall ensure that all
          cases of indiscipline are thoroughly investigated by their Centre
          Disciplinary Committees.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cases which, in the opinion of the College authorities merit
          dismissal or rustication shall be referred immediately to the College
          Management.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Co-ordinators and Supervisors shall adhere to procedures regarding
          rustication and dismissals.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To indulge in or be involved in any anti-social activity both within
          or outside the confines of any school activity or event, which tends
          to bring the name of the College into disrepute constitutes a
          misconduct.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Any act not expressly mentioned in this Code or in any regulation
          operating within the College, but deemed a misconduct, shall be
          reported to the College Management through the Principal, which shall
          refer the case to the appropriate Disciplinary Committee.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Principal shall have the power to dismiss or rusticate a student
          for tenable reasons bordering on acts of indiscipline and misconduct,
          both within or outside the College.

      We shall fight, fight and toil for generations to come
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord on our side we shall conquer the storms
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nation and the people shall see us ahead
    </p>
    <p>
      And all shall together rise, rejoice and sing
    </p>
    <p>
      Hallelujah! Praise the Lord
    </p>
    <p>
      God we pray help us to overcome. (2x)
