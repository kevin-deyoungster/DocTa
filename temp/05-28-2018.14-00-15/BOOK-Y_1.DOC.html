      PREFACE
    </h1>
    <p>
      This instructional manual is published in fulfilment of distance
      learner&rsquo;s need for a comprehensive handbook that offers a unique strategy
      for success by way of effective organisation of study manual in
      simplified and logical development of material with the sole aim of
      providing a guided approach in self-tuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of the entire material is simplified from leading
      professional sources and renowned publications in information and
      communication technology and hence presents an integrated outlook for an
      increased understanding of the principles and theories underlying
      information and communication technology studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manual particularly offers a unique approach for success by way of
      provision of copious answered model questions that are purposely designed
      for repeated practice and developing the requisite skill and confidence
      that comes about for tackling problems involving information and
      communication technology and its effectiveness in teaching and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writers draw a wide range of experience from their teaching career
      and appreciation for trainees&rsquo; difficulties in using I. C. T. in teaching
      and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manual is intended to provide for the needs of teacher trainees and
      candidates of colleges of education. It will also provide useful
      information to teachers in the use of computer in teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first unit discusses a world of computers; which includes the
      following topics;
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

      <strong>What is a Computer?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activity 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Think over the meaning(s) of computers and use your own words to describe
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever make use of the computer? What about mobile phones,
      telephones, televisions, watches or calculators?
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe you must be in a happy mood by now because all these mentioned
      devices are computers. So now, what will you say is computer?
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer is an <strong>electronic</strong> <strong>device</strong>
      capable of <strong>accepting data</strong> in a convenient form, which is
      automatically <strong>processed</strong> following a sequential set of
      instruction called program, which is also <strong>stored</strong> in a
      device, and <strong>producing</strong> results known as
      <strong>output</strong> or <strong>information</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer is a programmable multiuse machine that accepts data (raw
      facts and figures) and processes or manipulates it into information that
      can be used such as summaries or totals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer is any electronic device which is capable of accepting raw
      data, processes the data using a given set of instructions to produce the
      expected results (output) which we call information and stores or saves
      the output for future use by any suitable storage medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer can also be said to be a device that has ability to accept
      data, internally store, and execute a program of instructions, perform
      mathematical, logical and manipulate operations on data, and accept the
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer is a versatile electronic device that accepts input (data)
      process, stores and gives feedback (output).
    </p>
    <p>
      From the above definitions, we need to explain certain keywords in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Keywords in definition(s)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer is an <strong>electronic device</strong> because it uses
      electrical currents in performing its&rsquo; activities. We all know the state
      of electricity as <strong>off</strong> and <strong>on</strong> or absent
      or present of electrical pulse, which is represented in computing as
      <strong>0s</strong> and <strong>1s</strong>. These discrete values (0s
      and 1s) is what the computer uses to represent data and information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>computer accepts</strong> data; accepting data, here means
      that anything that you send into the computer be it quantities,
      characters, or symbols on which operations are performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>computer processes</strong> data means changing the data into
      meaningful information based on the instructions given. The computer
      gives out information after the processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data:</strong> Data comes in many forms; numbers, words, symbols.
      Data related to transactions, events and facts and on its own, it is not
      very useful. <em><strong>Data</strong></em> can be defined as the streams
      of raw facts and figures fed in to the computer to be processed before
      people can understand and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Input:</strong> It is the name given to the data fed (received)
      into the computer for processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Output:</strong> it can be defined as the process of displaying
      or printing the results of processing operations. This output refers to
      the expected result or information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information:</strong> refers to data that has been refined
      (converted or shaped) into a meaningful and more useful or intelligible
      form or context for an end user. <em><strong>Information</strong></em> is
      also data that has been processed, i.e. organized into a form that people
      can understand and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>NB</em></strong> Information is always made up of data, but
      not all data produce meaningful information. And someone information can
      be another persons&rsquo; data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner, let&rsquo;s consider these terms <em>data</em> and
      <em>information</em> very well. Sometimes these words are used
      inter-changeably but it is important to know the distinction between
      them. <em><strong>Data</strong></em> refers to the raw material from
      which useful results can be extracted and it is the valued added or
      usefulness associated with <em><strong>information</strong></em> which
      distinguishes it from data organized with respect to user requirements.
      (There will be further elaboration in our subsequent lessons).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer Literacy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner, in your own words can you explain what computer literacy
      is?
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe what you have said is in line with what has been explained
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literacy is the ability to read and write. In modern context, <strong>the
      word means reading and writing in a level adequate for written
      communication and generally a level that enables one to successfully
      function at certain levels of a society.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are <strong>so many</strong> types of literacy such as business,
      media, information, computer, technology, visual, and health, but for the
      purpose of this course in computing, the following will be considered:
      Computer literacy
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer Literacy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are so many definitions on computer literacy as outlined below:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          It is the level of expertise and familiarity someone has with
          computers and its applications.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is the knowledge and ability a person has to use a computer and
          technology efficiently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is the comfort level someone has with using computer programs and
          other applications that are associated with computers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is the knowledge and ability to use a computer and its software
          efficiently to accomplish practical tasks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is the understanding of the concepts, terminology, and operations
          that relate to general computer use.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Individuals who are very computer literate are sometimes called &ldquo;Power
      Users&rdquo;. Such a person should know how computers work and operate, that is
      how to turn on a computer, start and stop simple applications programs,
      save and print information. Perhaps the simplest way to explain computer
      literacy is the ability of one to understand how to use computers and
      also how others use computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Importance of Computer Literacy to the Trained Teacher</strong>
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Computer skills are a subject being specifically taught in schools
          especially from puberty where the ability of abstraction forms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Computers are used in teaching and learning. It is an integral part
          of the educational system and the trained teacher needs it in other
          to function effectively.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Computers are also used in schools for many applications such as in
          writing papers or in research especially on the internet to search
          for information.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Parts of a Computer System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having known the meaning of computer and computer literacy, just like the
      human body which has got parts, examples eyes, mouth, hand, etc, the
      computer system has also got parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let&rsquo;s now look at the parts of the computer system.

      Some of the parts of the computer are: system unit (system box), monitor,
      mouse, speakers and keyboard etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are <strong>three</strong> main parts of the computer namely the
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Keyboard</strong>; The component that closely resembles the
          typewriter is called the <strong>keyboard</strong>. It serves as a
          medium for sending data into the computer for processing. 2 types of
          keyboard; <strong>QWERTY</strong> and <strong>DVORAK.</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>System unit</strong>; It is the rectangular box, which houses
          the most of the electronic components that make up a computer system.
          For microcomputers, there are four basic types; <strong>Desktop ,
          Notebook, Tablet PC</strong> and <strong>Handheld system
          unit</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Monitor</strong>; The <strong>TV</strong>-like device is
          called the <strong>monitor</strong> or <strong>VDU</strong> (Visual
          Display Unit), is a screen (Visual Display Unit) that displays
          processed information to the user. 2 types are; <strong>Cathode-ray
          tube</strong> and <strong>Flat Panel monitors</strong>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The mouse has become a <strong>fourth</strong> integral part of the
      computer of late due to its versatility.

    </p>
    <p>
      The tiny device connected to the system unit through a chord resembling a
      tail is called a <strong>mouse</strong>. The <strong>mouse</strong> is
      the hand-held device that lets you point, click and move objects on the
      monitor (screen).

      Computers play major role in our daily lives. They are used in schools,
      government offices, industries and shops. You can use computer to
      communicate with your love ones, being it your family or friends, create
      household budget, book travel and movie tickets, or manage your small
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let take a keen note on major areas that computers are used for its
      importance. Our emphasis will dwell much in the field of education in
      general, and then we look at the benefit in using computer to the teacher
      and the student.

      The use of computers in education helps to develop or discover better
      alternative means of carrying out the educational process. Experience
      around the world in developing, industrialized and information-based
      nations has improved that training in the use and application of
      technology is the prime determining factor for improved student
      performance (in terms of both knowledge acquisition and skills
      development enabled by technology).
    </p>
    <p>
      In business and industry, you use computers to maintain accounts, create
      personnel records, track inventory, prepare presentation and reports,
      manage projects, and communicate by e-mail. You can use computers to
      design any type of publication ranging from simple newsletters to fashion
      magazines, marketing materials, books, or newspapers. Computers are use
      to keep track of products and check out at the cash registered. Banks use
      computers to send money all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In government organizations, we use computers to organize information by
      storing and updating records. Computers are also used for providing
      services to citizens. For example one can view information on current
      policies and government issues on a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the field of medicine, doctors use computers to review medical records
      of patients. Doctors also use computers to find information about latest
      drug available to treat a disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scientists, use computers for scientific research, and to gather and
      analyze information. For example they use computers to view images from
      space and to publish information on their recent research. Engineers use
      computers to make cars, trucks and airplanes. Architects use computers to
      design houses and other buildings. The police use computers to track down
      criminals. The military use computers to make and read coded messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In security wise, computer-controlled monitors play an important role in
      maintaining security in crowded areas such as the airport, banks, large
      departmental stores etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the appropriate question at this point is why are computers so
      powerful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Discuss the points raised below with your fellow mate(s)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why computers are so powerful</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Communication</strong>: Computers have communication
          abilities, which offer an extension capability, together with
          telephone lines, chatting, video conference, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Reliability</strong>: The computer is reliable because of the
          processing cycle it follows rigidly; the expected results should be
          achieved. Computers can be counted on to perform. They operate
          consistently and accurately without fail for long periods of time.
          They have built-in, self-checking features that assist in their
          maintenance. Because of its accuracy, computers are reliable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Accuracy</strong>: The computer gives exact information when
          appropriate input (data) is fed into it. Computers are accurate
          machines that process large volumes of information according to
          complex and receptive procedures. Remember that whenever your
          computer gives you wrong results, it implies that the computer as a
          wrong data from you, hence &ldquo;GIGO&rdquo; (garbage in garbage out).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage</strong>: Computer can keep or hold data or
          information permanently for future reference or use. With computers,
          records are stored on the diskettes that don&rsquo;t occupy any significant
          space on the table. In fact billions of characters are stored on
          disks that virtually occupy a small space.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Speed</strong>: Data processing using the computer is not
          only easy but also fast. computers can calculate tens of millions of
          times faster than the human brain and in seconds solve problems that
          would take dozens of experts some years to complete: Computer speeds
          are measured in four or more ways:
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Millisecond (one-thousandth of a second = 1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> second)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Microsecond (one-millionth of a second = 1x10<sup>-6</sup> second )
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Nanosecond (one-billionth of a second = 1x 10<sup>-9</sup> second)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Picosecond (one-trillionth of a second = 1 x 10<sup>-12</sup> second)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Femtosecond (one-quadrillionth of a second = 1 x 10<sup>-15</sup>
          second)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Economy</strong>: Computers are economical. Businesses using
          computers operate more efficiently and effectively since they can
          reduce labour costs, improve customer service and provide management
          with fast, accurate information about customers, products and sales.
          When we go to some hospitals, you will see a room full of patients&rsquo;
          records and fetching takes time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Versatility</strong>: the computer can be used to solve many
          problems provided a suitable program can be written. It is not like
          human who is restricted to only one or two professions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Disadvantages of using Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first five points gives it disadvantage in education
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          ICT materials like computer games have actually spoilt some students.
          It prevents them from studying.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Immoral activities go on in the school because of ICT facilities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Computer breakdown</strong>: when a computer system breaks
          down or when there is power failure, the computer cannot be used and
          that highly hinders the work of an organization.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Initial cost:</strong> The initial cost of a large
          installation is very high. Therefore, it may scare many people and
          organizations from computerizing their operations. Huge budgetary has
          to be allocated for ICT development whilst other important aspects of
          education are neglected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Computer fraud</strong>: It refers to the illegal use of the
          computer system or the manipulation of computer programs for personal
          gains.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Extensive system analysis and programming</strong>: The
          computer is run by software which is prepared by skilful system&rsquo;s
          analyst and programmers. Several years of investigation and
          preparation may have elapsed before the software becomes operational.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Invisible processing:</strong> Data being operated or
          processed by the computer is invisible by the human who is using the
          system or machine. Therefore, he or she cannot appreciate the work of
          the computer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Dislocation of employees</strong>: Since computers can
          combine the work of several employees into software, such employees
          may be redundant.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, you could see that computer play a major role in our daily
      activities hence the need for us as teacher and educators to really
      exploit the capabilities of the computer.

      <strong>Computing system</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      What comes to your mind when you hear about a computing system? Perhaps
      you are trying to look at the two separate words and trying to get the
      meaning from that. That is quite good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now examine the actual meaning of a computing system. We have
      already examined the meaning of computer. Now let us look at what a
      <strong>s</strong>y<strong>stem</strong> is. A system is a set of
      independent parts that together accomplish specific objectives. The
      components of a system are rationally, rather than randomly, organized
      and related. Besides good organization, a system is characterized by
      interrelationships with its parts, and central objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activity 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using your experience knowing the meaning of computer and system, can you
      explain in your own words what a computing system is?
    </p>
    <p>
      ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope your explanation of the computing system includes the key
      components. Congrats!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us look at a more detailed explanation of what a computing system
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computing System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Computing system includes more issues when you examine the meaning of
      computer. A computing system is the combination of hardware, software,
      data, procedures and you as a human being, all working together to get
      the most of using the computer. It should be noted that the components of
      the computing system (hardware, software, data, procedures, people)
      working together to provide the benefits of using a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of Components of a Computing System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Computing system has five components
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          People
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Procedure: rules and guidelines to follow when using the computing
          system
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Data
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Software
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Hardware
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>People</strong>: By far the most important component of a
      computing system is you as a human being or the person using the
      computer. You are the controlling office behind the computing system
      directing affairs and allowing all the components to communicate in a way
      that will enable the results to be achieved. By knowing the power and
      limitations of computing, you are able to select the proper applications
      to solve problems, produce information and become more efficient in your
      work. Basically there two people who uses computers and without such
      people computers will be no significance. These people are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          End users, those who use computer to operate (mostly application
          software) their day-to-day activities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Professional user, these are people who have specialized in the
          system build up and software developers, they include, IT
          professionals, Network Specialist, Programmers, System Analyst,
          Database Specialist etc.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Procedures</strong>: these are rules or guidelines for people to
      follow when using software, hardware, and data. They are documented in
      manuals written by computer specialist for particular organizations.
      Software and hardware manufactures also provide manual with their
      products. Procedures such as those found in operating manuals and other
      forms of documentations, are another critical part of the computing
      system. Without proper procedures, you may be at a loss how to use the
      computer correctly. Processing data into information requires careful
      planning and appropriate instructions. If accurate data are not input,
      the information delivered as output is useless. This phenomenon is called
      <strong>garbage-in</strong>, <strong>garbage-out</strong>, means that the
      output is only accurate as the input and the program that process the
      data. If you enter a meaningless series of numbers and letters, the
      computer will not automatically process the data into a list of names and
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though computers follow a program&rsquo;s instructions, you as the computer
      user must know which program to use and how to use it. The documentation
      manual can tell you how to start a program, which data needed to input
      and how to verify that the results are accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next three points will be dealt much with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Some Definitions of Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Data are raw or unorganized fact, figures, (sound, symbols texts,
      numbers, drawings etc.) that is yet to be processed by the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      OR
    </p>
    <p>
      Data consist of the raw, unprocessed facts that are yet to be processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data is the basic elements of information that a computer can process or
      produce. Data are obtained through measurement or observation. Data are
      the raw materials from which the computer produces information. Data are
      simply the numbers, symbols, or words events and transactions which have
      been recorded but not yet processed, into a form which is suitable for
      making decisions. Data are called raw facts because data alone may have
      no meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sources of Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Data can come from many sources, but the main sources of are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Internal data
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          External data
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Internal Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the data that is gathered from within an organisation like
      School, Hospital, and Company etc. This data can be in the form of
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Records of people employed by an organisation(e.g. names, age,
          salary)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Data from production department(e.g. number of machines, repair
          records)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Data from a school(e.g. names, age, teachers)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>External Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the data that is obtained from outside an organisation. It
      includes
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Taxation system (e.g. VAT)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Data from the market
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson, we&rsquo;ve discussed that computing system is the various
      elements that come together to make the computer function well. We then
      looked at the components that constitute computing system; as People,
      Procedure, Data, Hardware and software.

      <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the fourth lesson of Unit 1. In lesson 3, we looked at what a
      computing system is and discussed three component of a computing system.
      In this lesson we shall continue to discuss two extra components of a
      computing system namely hardware and software.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Explain role of hardware and software as components of computing

        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition of Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Information is the result of processing data into a form that can be
      useful to the computer user and is usually organized and understandable.
      (i.e. <strong>Information</strong> is therefore processed data). Someone
      information can becomes another person&rsquo;s data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Characteristics of Information</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Timely:</strong> Information must be ready when needed for
          correction and decision-making.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Precise:</strong> It must be exact and meaningful
          information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Relevant:</strong> It must be necessary and important for the
          purpose intended.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Concise:</strong> It must be short and brief for easy
          understanding
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Compact:</strong> It must be handy, bearing in mind
          relevance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Accurate:</strong> It must assume high level of correctness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cost effective:</strong> It should not cost too much to
          obtain information.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Source of Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Information can be acquired through the following means: people, news,
      letters, films, teaching, announcements, bulletins, magazine, books,
      radio, internet, news papers, music etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the tools for sending and receiving information are: radio, TV,
      calculator, telephone (including mobile phones), camera, microphone,
      talking drums, computers etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uses of Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Information is needed by organisations and other individuals for many
      purposes and they are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Planning
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Recording
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Controlling
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Measuring
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Decision-making
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Hardware (physical interface)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardware is the term used to define all the physical components
      (tangible) of the computer system. That is the part of the computer that
      can be seen or touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Categories of computer hardware</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, computer hardware can be classified under four (4) main
      categories.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Input devices</strong> such as keyboard, mouse, scanner,
          digitizer, a light pen, joystick and microphone.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Output devices</strong> such as monitor, printer and,
          speakers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>System Unit (Processing devices</strong> i.e. CPU);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage devices</strong> such as floppy and pen drive, CD,
          and DVD.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The inputs, outputs and backing storage units connected to the computer
      are referred to as <strong>peripheral devices</strong>. Peripheral
      devices are devices that are connected to and controlled by the computers
      CPU. Peripherals are attachments to the system unit that form the
      computer. Peripherals that are not controlled by or in communication with
      CPU are said to be OFF-LINE while those controlled by or in communication
      with the CPU are said to be ON-LINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us describe the categories of hardware briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of Input Devices</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are devices or equipment that is used to send data from the external
      world into the computer in a form that computer understands (0s and 1s)
      for the purpose of processing and storing. They are the hardware that
      facilitates the first stage of the Information Processing Cycle (see that
      under how computer function). Examples of input devices are; Keyboard,
      Mouse, Trackball, Sensor, Scanner, Joystick, Touchpad, Biometric system,
      Digital camera, Light pen Web cam, Digitizing tablet, Microphone, Optical
      Mark reader (OMR) Optical character recognition (OCR) Magnetic Ink
      Character Recognition (MICR), Pointing stick, barcode reader, and the
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of Output Devices</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      These devices translate information processed by the computer into a form
      that humans can understand. Thus they convey information from computer to
      the users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commonly used output devices are monitor, speaker, plotter, printer,
      headset, projector etc, permit the computer to communicate with you by
      presenting computer-prepared information in a form you can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary kinds of output are;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Soft Copy Output</strong>; is data or information that is display
      on screens or is in audio or voice form. It exists only electrically.
      This kind of output is not tangible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hard Copy Output</strong>; is data or information in printed
      form. This kind of output can be touched
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kinds of Output Devices</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Softcopy output devices</strong>; they are devices that
          present information on a displayed screen. This kind of output
          information cannot be touched. Examples are projectors, speakers,
          monitor, headset etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Hardcopy output devices</strong>; they present information or
          data on a paper. Examples are printers, plotters,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Audio output devices</strong>; these devices present
          information in a sound form. Eg are headset, headphones etc.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of Storage Devices</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      These devices hold data, information and program for a longer period
      until they are needed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storage devices consist of two part: the <strong>storage medium</strong>
      on which information is stored such as a CD or floppy disk;
      <strong>storage drive</strong> that writes information to the medium and
      reads information from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main types of storage media. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Primary</strong> <strong>Storage Media</strong>: this is the
          initial storage area that data and program are stored temporary
          before the CPU process or run them. The main example is
          <strong>RAM</strong>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Secondary</strong> <strong>Storage Media</strong>: these
          devices hold data and information permanently. Data and information
          on these devices can be retained after the computer has been shut
          down. Examples: hard disk, floppy disk, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification of Storage Medium;</strong> Storage medium are
      classify into two,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fixed Storage Medium</strong>: this device is mostly found
          grounded or attached to the computer system. Example, Hard disk
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Removable Storage Media</strong>: these are devices that can
          be easily removed by the computer user without causing any damage to
          the device. Example: CD Rom, pen drive, memory sticks etc.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Types of Technology that Store Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three major technology types that store information. These are
      <strong>magnetic</strong>, <strong>optical</strong> or
      <strong>laser</strong>, and <strong>flash memory</strong>. But for the
      purpose of our course, we will discuss the main types.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magnetic Storage</strong> is any storage method in which data is
      written and read using different patterns of magnetization in magnetic a
      material to store data. The information is accessed using one or more
      read/write heads. Magnetic storage media, primarily hard disks, are
      widely used to store computer data as well as audio and video signals.
      Other examples of magnetic storage media are floppy disk, and zip disks
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Optical Storage</strong> is any storage method in which data is
      written and read with a laser for archival or backup purposes. Typically,
      data is written to optical media, such as CDs and DVDs. Optical media is
      more durable than magnetic tape and less vulnerable to environmental
      conditions, on the other hand, it tends to be slower than typical hard
      drive speeds, and to offer lower storage capacities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of System Unit (Processing Unit)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the core of the computer system. It is a rectangular box that
      houses all components of the computer system. The box can be vertical or
      horizontal. The vertical type of system unit is called Tower and the
      horizontal type of the system unit is called desktop. Power supply,
      Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, hard disk, and motherboard are all
      housed in the system unit. All the devices that are connected to the
      system unit are called peripherals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of the processing device (CPU) will be treated in detail
      in unit 1 lesson 8.

      <strong>Software (intellectual interface)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Some Definitions of Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Software</strong> is a computer program, which is a series of
      logical and sequential step of instruction that the computer follows to
      solve a given problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Software</strong> is the set of instructions that your hardware
      executes to carry out a particular task for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Software</strong> or programs are the instructions needed to
      direct the computer to complete specific task.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are t<strong>wo</strong> major kinds of software: <strong>system
      software and application software.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>System software</strong>: It consists of <strong>operating
          system</strong> (which runs a computer), a <strong>utility</strong>
          (which performs maintenance or general-purpose chores), and <strong>a
          language</strong> (with which computer programs are created).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Application software</strong>: Application is a computer
          program designed to help people perform a certain type of work. The
          user interacts with application software. Some people describe the
          application software as &lsquo;<strong>end-user&rsquo; software or layer software
          closest to the user</strong>. Alternatively, application software
          consists of computer programs designed to satisfy a user&rsquo;s needs. The
          task or problem may require, for example, word processing, that
          permit user to use computer to enter and save text, delete text etc.
          spreadsheet that allow user to create graphs for easily
          interpretation of information
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From the discussion above, we can say that software is the set
      instructions controlling the computer&rsquo;s operation, that permit you to
      apply the computer as a general-purpose too to help you in a variety if
      tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activity 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In your own words explain the concept &ldquo;software&rdquo;, and mention at least
      three software programs not mentioned in this lesson that make today&rsquo;s
      computer easy to use.

    <p>
      We have learnt about software, hardware and software as components of

      <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner, welcome to lesson 5 of Unit 1. In lesson 4 of Unit 1, we
      discussed some components of a computing system, and in addition explain
      the role of hardware and software. In this lesson we shall discuss types
      of computers. We hope you are going to enjoy the lesson and perform all
      activities outlined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson you will be able to:

        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification of Computers by Capacity/Size</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Classification in term of capacity or size is based on the system
      architecture which includes processing speed, the storage capacity,
      memory speed and cost. Although there are many types of computers, it is
      not easy to define them now as it was a decade or two ago. The
      differences between types of computers were fairly obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more appropriate distinction than size or cost is one that arises from
      how computers are used and the services they capable of providing.
      Computers can be classified into five categories. In their chronological
      order, they are;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Supercomputers
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mainframe computers
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Minicomputers
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Microcomputers (Personal computers)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Microcontrollers (Embedded processors)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Supercomputers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A supercomputer is kind of computer, that has been optimized for speed
      and processing power. They are used for extremely calculation-intensive
      tasks such simulating nuclear bomb detonations, aerodynamic flows, and
      global weather patterns airline reservations. In such organizations, vast
      amount of information must be processed in short time to provide fast
      response to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the size or cost that classifies a computer as a supercomputer;
      it is processing speed and the special ability to process numerically
      intensive mathematical operations quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that other factors used to categorise computers are
      the following: Architecture, Processing speed, Primary storage, Secondary
      storage, Output Speed, Number of users, Cost
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong> are Cyber 205, Cray X-MP, Cray 2 and Cray I
      (this was for several years the fastest computer in the world). Cary X-MP
      is five to eight times faster than Cray 1.

      Supercomputer (this one is a Cray-2 from the 1980&rsquo;s)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mainframe Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The name mainframe originated after minicomputers appeared in the 1960&rsquo;s
      to distinguish the larger systems from the smaller minicomputers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mainframe computer is a large, powerful computer that handles the
      processing for many users simultaneously (up to several hundred users)
      and need a very high–speed printer. Users connect to the mainframe using
      terminals and submit their tasks for processing by the mainframe. A
      terminal is a device that has a screen and keyboard for input and output,
      but it does not do its own processing (they are also called dumb
      terminals since they can&rsquo;t process data on their own). The processing
      power of the mainframe is time-shared between all of the users. (Note
      that a personal computer may be used to &ldquo;emulate&rdquo; a dumb terminal to
      connect to a mainframe or minicomputer; you run a program on the PC that
      pretends to be a dumb terminal).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span id="terminal" class="anchor"></span>They are used in situations
      where a company wants the processing power and information storage in a
      centralized location. Mainframes are also now being used as high-capacity
      <a href="http://www.unm.edu/%7Etbeach/terms/net.html#server">server
      computers</a> for networks with many client workstations<span id="super"
      class="anchor"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, mainframe is a type of computer architecture that has the ability
      to quickly process a high volume of data, control and use of wide range
      of data storage, input and output devices and support a very large number
      of users at one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mainframe computer is used principally by large organizations such as
      Universities, large businesses, airlines, hospitals, government agencies
      and manufacturing companies and by computer service organizations such as
      service bureaus. These are large, powerful and <strong>expensive</strong>
      <strong>general-purpose.</strong> It processes <strong>64-bit
      words</strong>. They have an access time of <strong>15
      nanoseconds</strong>.

        Mainframe computer (this IBM z-series computer is about 6 feet tall)
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong> are IBM 360 and 370 (earliest), IBM 3084 and
      IBM 4381 (latest), Burroughs B7900, Amdahl 5860, Cyber 170 model and 855
      and NCR 8400.

    <p>
      <strong>Disadvantages of Mainframe Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          They are very expensive
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Not portable
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          They generate a lot of heat
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Minicomputers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Minicomputers make up the middle class of computer size and power. They
      can handle large volumes of data but not like the mainframe. They are now
      referred to as <strong>mid-range</strong> servers. They are physically
      bigger than micros and handle <strong>32-bit words</strong>. The original
      ones were 12-bit words. Memory access time is as fast as <strong>75
      nanoseconds</strong>. They also require a high–speed line printer and can
      support about 20 terminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples include</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          IBM System 36(S/36), Advance system 400 (AS/400), DEC PDP – 8 and
          PDP-11 and Vax-11/780, Vax-11/750, Vax-11/782, Vax-11/730. Etc

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Minicomputer systems are usually <strong>larger</strong> and <strong>more
      powerful</strong> than microcomputer systems and <strong>smaller</strong>
      and <strong>less powerful</strong> than mainframes. However, this is not
      always the case. <strong>There are some micros that are more powerful
      than the smallest minis and large minis that are more powerful than
      smaller mainframes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, you will probably hear the term <strong>departmental
      computer</strong> to describe the same type of system called a
      minicomputer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, it is not the size, power or cost of the computer that
      classifies it as a minicomputer or departmental computer; rather, it is
      the nature of the computer&rsquo;s use and the resources it can provide. These
      systems are often used to support business applications such as
      accounting, inventory control, order entry, payroll and personnel and
      manufacturing management. Although minicomputers do not support the
      extensive resources of large mainframe systems, they can easily support
      dozens of users.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Micro Computers (Personal Computers)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal computers usually referred to as &ldquo;<strong>PC</strong>&rdquo; are
      cheaper, smaller and contain less memory than mainframe systems and
      minicomputer. A single personal computer is generally used by only one
      person at a time. That certainly does not mean, however that a personal
      computer is less capable than its larger cousins. Personal computers are
      typically used at home, at school, or at a business. Popular uses for
      microcomputers include word processing, surfing the web, sending and
      receiving e-mail, spreadsheet calculations, database management, editing
      photographs, creating graphics, and playing music or games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal computers were made possible by the development of
      micro-processor, an integrated electronic circuit the size of your
      thumbnail that contains all of the needed parts of the computer&rsquo;s central
      processing unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the size of personal computers – personal computers used today
      has greater computing speed and power than a mainframe of only en years
      ago. The Apple II computer launched the personal computer revolution. For
      the first time, a practical and somewhat cost-effective computer was
      available. When the Apple II became available, the only alternatives were
      minicomputers costing a lot or mainframe computers where users share only
      the computer but a cost too high. It should also be said that it is not
      Apple II alone that caused the computer revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal computers come in two major varieties, desktop/tower computers
      and laptop computers.

    <p>
      ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification of Computers by Type</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Computers represent data in different forms. Some represent data in a
      continuous form while others represent data in discrete form or a
      combination of the two. Under classification by type, (thus data
      representation or principle of operation) these are;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Analogue Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a form of computer that uses continuous physical phenomena (data using
      physical qualities received from continuously varying variables) such as
      electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem
      being solved. It is sometimes called special-purpose computers. The
      reason is that they serve a specific purpose or function only. They are
      mostly used in the scientific and engineering fields as a control
      function in quality control which are used in measuring voltage, current,
      temperature and pressure etc Example: thermometer, slide rule,
      speedometer, hydrometer etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Digital Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A digital system uses discrete electrical voltage levels as codes for
      symbols. They deal directly with numerical quantities expressed in some
      form of numbering system. They are mostly used in data processing
      environment. It has a memory that solves problems by counting, adding,
      subtracting, multiplying and comparing. They are also called
      general-purpose computers. It is design to handle many kinds of function.
      Example: PC, laptop etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hybrid Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are blend of both analogue and digital computers in that they can
      perform the function of both computers. Hybrid computers are used to
      obtain a very accurate but not exact 'seed' value. It has the ability to
      either represent data in a numerical format using binary mode or by
      representing data as physical quantities using varying variables. They
      use their analogue part to collect data and use an interface called
      digitizer which converts analogue signals to digital form. Example:
      automated teller machine (ATM), money counting machine, traffic lights,
      air traffic control, aircraft, calculators and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Classification of Computers by Purpose</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the flexibility and operations, computers are either general
      or special purpose
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Purpose Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are computers designed to perform one specific task or restricted a
      class of problems. The component and functions are uniquely adapted to a
      particular situation, or institution etc. In such situation, the program
      of instructions that the computer may follow to solve the problem is
      built into, or permanently stored in the machine. They are frequently
      referred to us &ldquo;dedicated,&rdquo; because of their limitations. Examples are:

      <strong>General Purpose Computers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      These computers have the capability and flexibility of dealing with
      variety of different problems, and are able to act in response to
      programs created to meet different needs. A general purpose computer is
      one that has the ability to store different programs of instruction.
      Processing on data is done by changing the instruction mode (thus to
      perform a variety of operation). Example, personal computers.

      <strong>Activity 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      With experiences gained from the first six lessons of Unit one, how would
      you explain components of computer hardware?
    </p>
    <p>
      ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe your explanation came up with some of the issues explained
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Components of Computer Hardware</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer system consists of a central processing unit (CPU), input
      devices, storage devices and output devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer, regardless of its size and computing function, solves
      problems by accepting data, performing certain operations on those data
      and presenting the results of those operations. Its operations are guided
      by instructions in the form of program writing by a person who identified
      an activity that would benefit from the application of a computer task.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How Computers Function (Information Processing Cycle)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before processing can occur, the data must get into the system by means
      of input device. The computer performs the necessary calculations of
      manipulations on the data; finally the organised information is displaced
      by the output device. Therefore, data follow through the system according
      to the following steps; <strong>input</strong>,
      <strong>processing</strong>, <strong>output</strong> and
      <strong>storage</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The flow of a computing operation begins with data being input to the
      computer, the computer then processes the data – transforms it into
      information that is output which can be stored on a storage medium).
    </p>
    <p>
      In some books the information processing cycle comprises with five
      stages, with distribution stage being the last stage of the processing
      cycle. But for the purpose of this course we will deal with four stages.
      Your course tutor will further explain the distribution stage together
      with devices that help in distributing information. Let take a good look
      at the four stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Input Stage (receiving data)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first stage in the information processing. Where data is
      entered or captured electronically. The captured data is converted to a
      form that can be processed by the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of input hardware are: keyboard (QWERTY and DVORAK), scanner,
      joystick mouse microphone, and the like. An input can be sound, image,
      symbols, letters, numbers, shapes etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Processing Stage (data manipulation)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the stage where data is manipulated or processed by the
      micro-processor or the central processing unit to become meaningful
      information. Data goes through some manipulation processes such
      recording, sorting, classifying, calculation, editing etc. The processing
      device is the <strong>CPU;</strong> examples of CPU or microprocessors
      are Pentium, Celeron, AMD, and MC68010.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Output Stage (displaying result as information)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage the information or result obtained from the data is
      displayed in a form usable by people. At this an output can therefore be
      said as information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of output devices are: speakers, printers, monitors etc. (refer
      more in unit one lesson 4 under components of computer hardware).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Storage Stage (storing information)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      After displaying the information on the monitor or hard copy from
      printer, it can be stored for future use or reference. This stage is
      important if you don&rsquo;t want to repeat stage 1&amp;2 any time you deal
      with a particular data. The arrows in the diagram, pointing to storage
      stage and processing stage are bidirectional. Which simply means,
      information on a storage medium can be processed directly and give
      output, without necessarily passing through the first stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example of storage media: Floppy disks, compact disc, flash drive, hard
      disk etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Distribution Stage (information are shared)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The last stage of the information processing cycle involves the
      distribution of the information created. This stage is mostly facilitated
      by human using some of the basic ICT tools such as telephone, electronic
      mail, fax machine etc. sometime the distribution information is used by
      other people as data input for other processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although computers have many applications, they can perform only
      <strong>three basic tasks</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Arithmetic functions on numeric data (adding, subtracting,
          multiplying and dividing)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Testing of relationships between data and items (by comparing values)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Storage and retrieval of data
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These tasks accomplish really no more than people can, but the computer
      can do the task faster, more accurately and more reliable that the
      average person. A computer can solve complex mathematical problems in
      fractions of a second, work with the greatest accuracy imaginable and
      store great volumes of data. A disparity of performance between a
      computer and a person would be readily evident if the task, for example,
      involved the multiplication of two-thirty-digit number.
    </p>
    <h6 id="data-representation-in-the-computer">
      Data Representation in the Computer
    </h6>
    <p>
      As we know already, computers manipulate data to produce information. In
      this section we shall find out how data are represented in the computer,
      which also means how the computer &ldquo;understands&rdquo; data. Computer is an
      electronic device and for that matter uses electricity. Which can be
      either on (1s) or off (0s), this makes information to be handled in the
      computer by devices such as transistors, integrated circuits,
      semiconductors and cables, all of which can only indicate two states or
      conditions. Transistors are conducting or non-conducting; magnetic
      materials are either magnetized or non-magnetized in one direction or in
      the opposite direction; a pulse or voltage is present or absent. All data
      is represented within the computer by the presence or absence of these
      various signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a two state on /off arrangement, one state can represent a 1 digit
      whereas the other as 0 digit. <strong>Therefore, the basic number system
      used by the computer is the binary system (Bi-means &ldquo;two&rdquo;)</strong>. This
      two-state situation allows computers to use the binary system to
      represent data and programs. In the binary system, each 0 and 1 is called
      a <strong>bit</strong>, the smallest storage unit of information in
      computer system. A bit is a unit data in binary system that can take a
      value of <strong>1</strong> (on) or <strong>0</strong> (off). Thus, in
      the computer the 0 can be represented by the electrical current off (or
      at low voltage) and programs that go into the computer are represented in
      terms of these numbers. Bits can be grouped in various combinations to
      represent characters of data such as numbers, letters, and punctuation
      marks. For the computer, numbers, alphabetic characters and special
      symbols must be reduced to representations by 1s (on) and 0s (off) called
      binary numbers or machine language, their reliance upon a language
      comprised of only binary digits 0 and 1, these systems are called digital
      computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of eight bits <strong>(00000000)</strong> represent one natural
      language character and is called <strong>a byte. Information or data
      stored in computer system are expressed in number of bytes,</strong> and
      character is usually represented by 1 byte. For example the letter H is a
      translation of the electronic signal 01001000, or
      off-on-off-off-on-off-off-off or no-yes-no-no-yes-no-no-no. When you
      press the key for H on the computer keyboard, the character is
      automatically converted into the series of electronic impulses that the
      computer recognizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Binary Coding System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The two popular coding scheme system, use to transform standard character
      sets consist of letters and numbers into their binary equivalents are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>EBCDIC</strong> (<strong>E</strong>xtended
          <strong>B</strong>inary <strong>C</strong>oded
          <strong>D</strong>ecimal <strong>I</strong>nterchange
          <strong>C</strong>ode). Commonly used in IBM machine. Pronounced
          eb-see-dick and it&rsquo;s used primarily for large computers
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>ASCII</strong> (<strong>A</strong>merican
          <strong>S</strong>tandard <strong>C</strong>ode for
          <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>I</strong>nterchange).
          Pronounced as-key, this is the most widely used binary code for
          microcomputers and mid-range server. It represents each character
          with eight bits in the computer&rsquo;s memory before process.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The ASCII and EBCDIC coding schemes are sufficient for English and
      Western European languages but are not large enough for Asian and other
      languages that use different alphabets. Unicode is coding scheme capable
      of representing all the world&rsquo;s current languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us try our hands on how to convert decimal digit to binary digit vice
      versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Conversion from Decimal to Binary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversion from decimal to its equivalent binary is called
      <strong>straight binary code</strong> e.g.54=00110110
    </p>
    <p>
      In this conversion the most common format that we are familiar with is
      the continuous division of the decimal by two (which is the base).
      Example 54 to base two will be done this way.

      Taken your answer from the bottom of the table we have 00110110.

    <p>
      There is also another simple format that we can apply here to convert
      decimal number to binary and that is using the exponential values of the
      base in question. in this case we are dealing with base two, so we are
      going to start from 2<sup>0</sup> to 2<sup>7</sup> and then consider only
      the numbers that add up to 54. You seem to be confused, let&rsquo;s try
      something out.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        54<sub>10</sub>to base 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        2<sup>7</sup> 2<sup>6</sup> 2<sup>5</sup> 2<sup>4</sup> 2<sup>3</sup>
        2<sup>2</sup> 2<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>0</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        168 64 <em>32 16</em> 8 <em>4 2</em> 1
      </p>
      <p>
        0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We are dealing with 54 therefore we consider numbers that add up to 54
      and all the remaining digits are considered to be zero (0).
    </p>
    <p>
      We have 32,16,4 and 2 adding up to 54.
    </p>
    <p>
      32+16+4+2=54. You can see that these digits are underlined and assigned
      the values 1 and the remaining are given zeros. Therefore writing from
      the left 54 to base 2 equals 00110110. You can try more examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Conversion from Binary to Decimal</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have converted 54 from decimal to binary, lets now try to reconvert
      from the binary state to decimal.
    </p>
    <p>
      0011010110<sub>2 to base10</sub>= 0<sup>7</sup> 0<sup>6</sup>
      1<sup>5</sup> 1<sup>4</sup> 0<sup>3</sup> 1<sup>2</sup> 1<sup>1</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      0 + 0 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0
    </p>
    <p>
      =54<sub>10</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Steps</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>First</strong>: consider the place value for each binary digit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Second</strong>: use the place values as exponential values for
      the base (BASE 2) and multiply by the binary digit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NB//</strong>: Please use asterisk sign (*) as multiplication in
      ICT, never use the times symbol (x).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Third</strong>: sum the results to get your final answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NB//</strong>: please do not skip any of the procedure given in
      the example above.

    <p>
      <strong>Forms of Computer Storage</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bits and bytes are the building blocks of data .Bits are important in
      computing because semiconductor and other memory media are more suited to
      data storage in binary form. At the level of machine language, data are
      stored and manipulated in bit form.
    </p>
    <p>
      A byte is a group of bits that the computer perceives and operates on as
      a single unit. Bytes lengths vary according to machine model and
      operation system. A <strong>computer word</strong> is a group of bits
      treated as a single entity by the control unit, the registers and other
      part of the CPU. Depending on the machine model they may be 8, 16, 2, 32,
      48, 60, or 64 bits, various number system rules facilitate translation
      from bites to bytes in the CPU. Translation rules called computer codes,
      allow the CPU to convert back and forth from characters to bits and
      bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally data and information move between the routing and input/output
      circuits and the memories in the form of bytes. Basically 8 bits equal a
      byte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bytes are often referred to in conjunction with the unit
      <strong>K</strong> (kilo), which stands for (2<sup>10</sup> but usually
      rounded off to 1,000. For example 10K byes or 100 kilobytes (K or KB)
      equal 102,400 units of storage. Another unit of measure is the megabyte
      (MB) which is approximately 1,000,000 bytes. For example 100 megabytes
      are equal to 102,400,444 bytes of storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>data word</strong> is used to store numbers and combination of
      characters. On a single machine model there may be several lengths or
      formats for instruction and data words.
    </p>
    <p>
      To handle the input, output and storage of data we need to define larger
      data structures involving characters, fields, records and database. These
      structure are all part of the data storage hierarchy shown below.

      Data Storage Hierarchy
    </p>
    <p>
      You have just learnt about the technical aspects about the byte, but it
      is perhaps easier to think about a byte in terms of characters – one byte
      can be considered to be one character. To store the name Edwards Adjei
      would require 14 bytes, one for each character in the name plus one more
      for the space between the first and the last name (space is a character,
      nit empty void to the computer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual data items are stored as groups of characters (bytes) in a
      <strong>field</strong>. A name address, city, state and zip code would
      each be contained in five individual five data fields. Collected together
      these fields would be stored in a <strong>record</strong>. Finally all
      records containing similar data would be stored in a
      <strong>file</strong>. How computer goes about storage and retrieving
      data would be discussed later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have learned from this lesson what data goes through before we get our
      information (thus the information processing cycle and its&rsquo; stages). We
      identified the three basic task of a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again we&rsquo;ve looked at how data is being represented in computers,
      together with the two popular binary coding systems. The last thing we
      discussed in this lesson was the forms of computer storage, each unit of
      storage in a computer (bits, bytes, characters and words) has a
      particular function relative to hardware, storage and transfer and
      programming.

    <p>
      You are warmly welcome to lesson 8 of Unit 1. In lesson 7 we discussed
      about how the computer functions with specific reference in data
      processing and data representation. In this lesson we shall discuss the
      Central Processing Unit (CPU) in detail.

      <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      CPU (Central Processing Unit) often called the
      <strong>Processor</strong>, is the &lsquo;brain&rsquo; of the computer. It is the
      core physical component of the computer system. It's typically a square
      ceramic package plugged into the motherboard, with a large heat sink on
      top (and often a fan on top of that heat sink). All instructions the
      computer will process are processed by the CPU, therefore;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The CPU controls and coordinates the operation of the entire computer
          system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The CPU coordinates with the other hardware and software components
          of the computer system to execute any given operation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It follows the instructions of the software (programs) to manipulate
          data into information
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Central Processing Unit (CPU) controls the interpretation and
      execution of computer instructions. It is responsible for instructing the
      computer to carry out calculations and to transfer data between parts of
      the computer system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CPU functions by breaking down a complex task into a number of
      discrete, simple steps. Each step is governed by a programme
      <strong>Instruction</strong>. Instruction is a coded program step up that
      tells the computer what to do for a single operation in a program. The
      instructions that form a program are stored in specific locations in main
      memory. These instructions are then brought into the CPU and executed
      sequentially. An instruction consists of an <strong>operation</strong>.
      <strong>Operation</strong> is the action specified by a single computer
      instruction, executed at machine level. <strong>Operation</strong> tells
      the CPU which function to perform, and an <strong>operand</strong> which
      defines the operation in more detail. Some examples of operation include
      transferring the contents of one memory location into the CPU, relocating
      the data from one memory location to a new memory location, increasing
      the value of a number in a memory by one or storing the sum of two
      numbers in a particular memory location.

      <img src="media/image10.png" width="378" height="92">Some of the
      processor types are Pentium I, II, III, IV, M, Celeron M, Dual Core and
      many more. They can either be in the form of Pin Grid Array (PGA) or the
      Slot Type (SCC).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Component of CPU</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The CPU consists of three (3) main parts. They are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Control Unit (CU),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) and the

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Register.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these devices has a specific purpose in enabling the computer to
      carry bout its functions. Let study each of them.

      <strong>Functions of the components of CPU</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>The</strong> <strong>control</strong> <strong>Unit</strong>
          (CU); directs electric signals between main memory (RAM) - which
          temporarily holds data, instructions, and processed information and
          ALU. It also directs instructions between main memory and
          output/input devices. It interprets each instruction issued by a
          program and then initiates the appropriate action to carry out the
          instruction. It directs and controls all the activities in the
          system. In other word, it tells the rest of the computer system how
          to carry out a program&rsquo;s instruction. The control unit has two
          responsibilities i.e., instruction interpretation and instruction
          sequencing.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In instruction interpretation the control unit reads instruction form
        the memory and recognizes the instruction type, gets the necessary
        operand and sends them to the appropriated functional unit (input unit,
        output unit, memory, ALU). The signals necessary to perform desired
        operation are taken to the processing unit and results obtained are
        sent to the specified destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In instruction sequencing control unit determines the address of the
        next instruction to be executed and loads it into program counter.

            <strong>Arithmetic</strong> <strong>and</strong>
            <strong>Logic</strong> <strong>Unit</strong>
            (<strong>ALU</strong><em>)</em>; performs arithmetic, comparison,
            and logical operations. The <strong>arithmetic operations</strong>
            are the fundamental math operations. As you might guess, arithmetic
            operations are the fundamental math&rsquo;s operations: addition (+),
            subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (÷).
            <strong>Comparison operations</strong> involve, comparing two piece
            of data to seen whether one is equal to (=), greater than (&gt;),
            etc.<strong>Logical operations</strong> use conditions along with
            logical operators such as <strong>AND</strong>,
            <strong>OR</strong>, and <strong>NOT.</strong>

            track of instructions, and hold the locations and results of these
            operations. They hold materials that are to be processed
            immediately. The control unit for instance fetches an instruction
            from memory and places it in a decoding register before determining
            its purpose. The computer loads the program instructions and data
            from main memory into the register just prior to processing, which
            helps the computer process fast.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fetching</strong> is the process of obtaining program&rsquo;s

          RAM and move to the CPU.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Decoding</strong> is the process of translating the program&rsquo;s
          binary code instruction into commands the CPU understand and can
          execute.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          <strong>Executing</strong> is the process of carrying out the

    <p>
      Earlier, the CPU was described as having four functions, fetching,
      decoding, executing and storing. These functions, are carried out in that
      sequence during what is called a <strong>machine cycle</strong>. The
      machine cycle consists of two parts. The first part is the
      <strong>instruction cycle, or instruction time (i – time)</strong> is the
      time it takes the control unit to fetch and decode an instruction that is
      retrieving it from an address in the computer&rsquo;s main memory and
      determining what task the instruction requires. The second part of t he
      cycle is called <strong>execution cycle or execution time (e-
      time)</strong>,is the time it takes control unit to execute (actually
      operation carried out) and the new data resulting from the operation are
      stored in memory. (Refer to diagram in machine cycle).

      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Buffers are also temporary data-holding areas built either in the CPU or
      into input or output devices. No matter how fast your disk or printer may
      appear to be, it is much slower than the CPU, so data being sent to or
      from input/output devices are placed by the CPU into buffers so that the
      slower devices do not hold back efficient processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed at which the computer is able to complete the machine cycle is
      considered one measurement of the computer&rsquo;s performance. You can compute
      the total time required for a machine cycle by adding together the i-time
      and e-time. Some of computer professionals measure a CPU&rsquo;s speed
      according to how many <strong>millions of instruction per second
      (</strong>MIPS<strong>)</strong> it can process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed at which the computer is able to complete the machine cycle
      depends on three characteristics; the system clock, bus width and word
      size. Earliest computer models performed operations at a rate of 4.77
      megahertz. Basically the speed of computers are measured in
      <strong>hertz</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Clock unit or system clock</strong> it dictates how fast the CPU
      operates. Today&rsquo;s personal computers work at 16 to 33 megahertz.
      <em><strong>Megahertz</strong></em>, which is translated as millions of
      cycles per second, is simply the measurement of how fast the computer is
      able to turn a circuit on and off. Ability to complete a machine cycle is
      governed by the more than just the system clock rate. Depending on t he
      nature of instruction and on design of the computer&rsquo;s bus width and word
      size, more than one cycle, may be needed to complete a single machine
      operation. Therefore the speed of the system clock alone is not necessary
      a good measurement of system performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bus</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A bus is a common electrical pathway between the various components of
      the computer. The bus connects all parts of the CPU and the input and
      output devices as well. Think of the bus as a road. A narrow, single-lane
      road permits limited, one-way traffic, whereas a superhighway has the
      capacity for many vehicles at one time, going in different directions.
      The concept applies fairly well to the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier personal computers used an 8-bit data bus design. The design
      limited data to one traffic and only one bit at a time could be
      transmitted. As processor capacity developed, newer buses with 16-bit or
      32-bit paths were introduced. The latest developments in bus design
      include multidirectional data buses. These bus designs permits faster
      data flow because they permit multiple operations to be completed, such
      as sending output to the printer while taking in keyboard input.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Word size</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer word is the number of adjacent bits that can be stored and
      manipulated as a unit. Some of the newer computers manipulate a 32-bit
      word whereas older models have word length of 8 to 16 bits. Word lengths
      range up to 128 bits for supercomputers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you really want to determine a computer&rsquo;s relative performance, you
      should look at <strong>throughout</strong>, the computer&rsquo;s ability to
      start and end a complete task. It is advisable to always test on some
      more relevant factor that you can understand; for example, how long does
      it take the computer to calculate and output a financial analysis from a
      spreadsheet program.
    </p>

      <strong>Summary</strong>

    <p>
      Dear learner, how did you find this lesson? Indeed, very interesting and
      computers are really powerful. We have looked at the processing device in
      detailed, the major constitute of the microprocessor, how the CPU process
      data with specific reference to instruction cycle and execution cycle. We

      <strong>The Main Memory/Primary Memory/ Primary Storage</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not know that most of the electronic items you use every day have
      some form of memory. Here are just a few examples of the many items that
      use memory:
    </p>
    <ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these devices uses different types of memory in different way!
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory is the most important component next to the CPU
    </p>
    <p>
      During processing, the processor places instructions to be executed and
      data needed by those instructions into memory. This <strong>memory is a
      temporary storage place for data, instructions, and information</strong>.
      The main memory is the collection of slots each of which can store one
      byte of instruction or data. Each byte of memory has numeric labels for
      its location called <strong>address</strong>. The user memory in most
      personal computers (PC) is limited to the address from 00000-9fffff that
      is six hundred and forty (640) kilobytes (KB). This limitation is placed
      by the operating system. The operating system is a program, which manages
      the hardware, software and information efficiently, (we&rsquo;ll discuss it in
      our next lesson). Memory stores three basic items:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      A byte (character) is the basic storage, unit in memory as well as all
      storage devices. When application program instructions and data transfer
      into memory from storage devices, the instructions and data exist as
      bytes. Each byte resides temporarily in a location in memory called an
      <strong>address</strong>. An <strong>address is the unique number that
      identifies the location of byte in memory</strong>. For instance, seats
      in state transport such as VIP are similar to addresses in memory: (1) a
      seat holds one person at a time and an address in memory holds a single
      byte, (2) both a seat and an address can be empty, and (3) a seat has a
      unique identifying numbers and so does a memory address. To access data
      or instructions in memory, the computer references the addresses that
      contain bytes of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manufacturers&rsquo; state memory and storage sizes in terms of the number of
      bytes the device has available for storage. A <strong>kilobyte</strong>
      of memory, abbreviated <strong>KB</strong> or <strong>K</strong>, is
      equal to exactly 1,024 bytes. To make memory and storage definitions
      easier to identify, computer users often round a kilobyte down to 1,000
      bytes. For example, if a memory chip can store 100 KB, it can hold
      approximately 100,000 bytes (characters). A <strong>megabyte
      (MB)</strong> is equal to approximately one million bytes. A
      <strong>gigabyte (GB)</strong> equals approximately one billion bytes.

    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Electronic</strong>: Its operations are wholly electronics
          and consequently very fast and reliable. It is made up of semi-
          conductor storage, which consists of very small circuit (is a path
          through which electronic current passes).

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Immediate access</strong>: Data is almost naturally
          accessible from the main memory because of its electronic operation.
          Data is also retrieved from main storage in much lesser time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Locations</strong>: It contains several compartments called
          locations. Each location has a unique address.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The process of entering data into storage is called
      <strong>writing</strong>. When data is/are placed in, or written to
      storage, they replace what was originally there. The process of
      retrieving data from storage is <strong>reading</strong>. Reading does
      not change the data in any way.

      <strong>Types of Memory</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The system unit contains two type of memory;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>RAM</strong> (Random Access Memory)
        </p>
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It often referred to as the main memory, primary memory, or internal
      memory. It is the temporary storage area for data, instructions,
      programs, and information for the processors during execution of
      instruction. It consists of memory chips that can be read from and
      written to by the processor and other devices. Data contained in RAM is
      held there temporally until it is no longer needed or the computer is
      turned off. When the computer is powered on, certain operating system
      files (such as the files that determine how your windows desktop
      displays) load from a storage device such as a hard disk into RAM. These
      files remain in the RAM as long as the computer is running. As additional
      programs and data are requested, they also load from storage into RAM.
      RAM takes its name from the fact that it allows data to be accessed
      randomly by the CPU. The processor interprets the data while it is in
      RAM. During this time, the contents of RAM may change. RAM can hold
      multiple programs simultaneously, provided the computer has enough RAM to
      accommodate all the programs. The program with which you are working
      usually displays on the screen. The amount of RAM on the computer
      determines the amount of programs and data a computer can handle at one
      time, which affects overall performance. The more RAM, the faster the
      computer will respond. The more primary storage available means that more
      instructions and data can be loaded into the computer. Many applications
      require specific amount of memory, else application package cannot be
      used. Most computers have provisions for adding individual RAM chips to
      the main circuit board or adding RAM though expansion cards.

      Two basic types of RAM chips exist: dynamic RAM chips (DRAM) and static
      RAM chips (SRAM).

      <strong>Significance of the RAM</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Data and programs are held in RAM before processing can be done. The
      program and data should be of a size that the RAM can contain. (It is
      important to note that the application to be used and the operating
      system depend on the RAM size). If the size of the RAM is not enough to
      accommodate the operating system and still have enough space to hold
      other software and data, then the purpose of purchasing a computer system
      will not be achieved.

      <strong>Some Basic Terminologies on Memory Capacity</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      How many 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s will a computer&rsquo;s main memory or a storage device
      such as a hard disk hold? The following terms are used to denote
      capacity:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Bit</strong>: It is a binary digit (0 or 1). It is the
          smallest unit of measurement.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Nibble</strong>: It is half a byte. In other words, it is a
          group of 4 bits.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Byte</strong>: A group of 8 bits is called a byte, and a byte
          represents one <strong>character</strong>, digit, or other value. The
          capacity of computer&rsquo;s memory or a diskette is expressed in numbers
          of bytes or generally in multiple of bytes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Kilobyte</strong>: A kilobyte (K, KB) is about 1000 bytes.
          (Actually, it&rsquo;s precisely 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 bytes but the figure
          is commonly rounded).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Megabyte</strong>: A megabyte (M, MB) is about 1 million
          (10<sup>6</sup>) bytes (i.e. 2<sup>20</sup> = 1 048 576 bytes).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Gigabyte</strong>: A gigabyte (G, GB) is about 1 billion
          (10<sup>9</sup>) bytes (i.e. 2<sup>30</sup>= 1 073 741 824 bytes).
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Terabyte</strong>: A gigabyte (T, TB) represents about 1
          trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) bytes (i.e. 2<sup>40</sup> =
          1,009,511,627,776 bytes).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Petabyte</strong>: A new measurement accommodates the huge
          storage capacities of modern databases a petabyte represents about
          million gigabytes (10<sup>15</sup>) bytes or (10<sup>6</sup>)
          gigabytes (i.e. 2<sup>50</sup> = 1, 125,899, 906, 844,624).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Word</strong>: A computer <strong>word</strong> is the number
          of bits that make up a unit of data as defined by the computer
          system. Common word length is usually related to the capacity of the
          <strong>computer&rsquo;s bus or bus lines</strong>. Examples of word sizes
          are 8 bits word, 16 bits word, 32 bits word, and 64 bits word.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Read Only Memory (ROM)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an integrated circuit programmed with specific data at the time of
      manufacture that start up the computer. That is, memory chips storing
      data that only can be read. ROM chips contain data, instructions, or
      information that is recorded permanently. For example, ROM contains the
      <strong>basic input/output system (BIOS)</strong>, which is a sequence of
      instructions the computer follows to load the operating system, checks
      other hardware connected to the system unit (keyboard, screen (monitor)
      disk drives and so on) and other files when you first turn on the
      computer..ROM chips are also use in many gadgets. For example, ROM chips
      in many printers contain data for font.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manufacturers of ROM chips often record the data, instructions, or
      information on the chips when they manufacture the chip. These ROM chips,
      called <strong>firmware,</strong> contain permanently written data,
      instruction, or information. The BIOS is firmware that contains the
      computer&rsquo;s start-up instructions. The instructions stored in the ROM chip
      are &ldquo;hard wired&rdquo;.

    <p>
      <strong>Characteristics of the Read Only Memory (ROM)</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It contains items, which have been permanently written into it. A
          specific function has been burnt into the chip at a time of
          manufacture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is non-volatile. It does not lose its data even when the computer
          is switched off. Because of this, it is used for permanent purposes
          such as control function. The contents of ROM are for system use and
          as such not accessible to the user. ROM can be found on the mother
          board and it contains the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) software.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Variations of ROM chips</strong> are;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Programmable Read-Only Memory (<strong>PROM</strong>)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (<strong>EPROM</strong>)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory
          (<strong>EEPROM</strong>)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Flash Memory</strong>, also known as <strong>flash
          ROM</strong> or <strong>flash RAM</strong>. Many current computer
          uses flash BIOS. With flash BIOS, the computer easily can update the
          contents of the BIOS chip, if necessary. Flash memory chip store data
          and programs on many handle devices such as cellular telephone,
          printers, digital recorders and cameras. Removable flash memory
          allows users to transfer data and information conveniently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Memory
          (<strong>CMOS</strong>) store configuration information about the
          computer. This information includes the type of disk drives,
          keyboard, and monitor; the current data and time; and other start-up
          information needed when you turn on the computer. CMOS chips use
          battery power to retain this information even when the power to the
          computer is off. Unlike standard ROM, the computer can change
          information in CMOS, such as when you change from standard time to
          daylight saving time or when you add new hardware devices to the
          computer.

    <p>
      In this lesson we learnt that about the memory as temporary storage area
      for the processor during program execution. We also discussed the types
      of memory and its characteristics and examples each, from the discussion
      we have noted that both RAM and ROM generally behave as holding or
      storing information for the user. Lastly, we&rsquo;ve learnt the differences
      between the types of memory.

      <strong>Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Software consists of the instructions that tell the computer how to
      perform a task or what to do. Software is written in special code by
      programmers. In most instances, the word software and program are
      interchangeable. Software is divided in two:

      <li>
        <p>
          Application software
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>System Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Programs that control and direct the operation of computer hardware are
      system software. System software controls the allocation and usage of
      hardware and other resources and enables application software to run. It
      is the software that the computer uses to manage its own internal
      activities. System software acts as the interpreter that allows you and
      your application software to access the physical hardware devices and
      other resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A computer interacts with both the system software and application
      software to accomplish a task)
    </p>
    <p>
      System software is not a single program. Rather it is a collection or a
      system of programs that handle hundreds of technical details with little
      or no user intervention. System software consists of four types of
      programs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Operating systems</strong> are programs that coordinate
          computer resource, provide a user interface, and run application.
          (we&rsquo;ll discuss it in detail later)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Utilities</strong>, also known as <strong>service
          programs</strong>, perform specific tasks related to managing
          computer resources. They are use to perform task like Backup, Data
          recovery, file defragmentation, Disk repair, Virus protection, data
          completion
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples of utility programs are:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Antivirus</strong>: They are programs that guard your computer
      system against viruses and other damaging programs that can invade the
      computer system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Backup programs</strong>: Programs that make copies of files to
      be used in case the originals are lost or damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>File compression programs</strong>: Are programs that reduce the
      size of files so they requires less storage space and can be sent easily
      via the internet e.g., WinZip, Winrar
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uninstall program</strong>: Program that allow you to safely and
      completely remove unneeded programs and files from your hard disk.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Device drivers</strong> are specialized programs designed to
          allow particular input or output devices to communicate with the rest
          of the computer system. It helps the computer to control peripheral
          devices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Language translators</strong> convert the programming
          instructions written by programmers into a language that computer
          understand and process.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Operating System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is collections of programs and instructions that controls and
      coordinate the operations of the computer system (the hardware and
      software components.).
    </p>
    <p>
      An <strong>operating system</strong> or <strong>OS</strong>, is a
      software program that enables the computer <a href=
      "http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hardware.htm"><em>hardware</em></a>
      to communicate and operate with the computer software. Without a computer
      operating system, a computer and <a href=
      "http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/software.htm"><em>software</em></a>
      programs would be useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a set of programs that controls and supervises a computer system&rsquo;s
      hardware and manages the application software. It is the foundation on
      which other application programs word, excel and access run. It controls
      the application software and manages how hardware devices work together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operating system acts as the master control program that runs the
      computer. It helps the computer to control the peripheral devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      An operating system is a set of programs that controls and supervises a
      computer system&rsquo;s hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its purpose is to manage the hardware for the most efficient use of
      computer resources and to provide an interface between a user application
      programme and the hardware. The operating system dramatically increased
      the efficiency of the CPU. By providing a standard set of instructions
      for commonly used hardware functions, it took the burden of programming
      every detail of an operation of the programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the computer is running, the operating system resides in the
      computer&rsquo;s memory, so the details of an operating are received and
      executed by the computer at computer speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of Operating System are MS-DOS, Microsoft windows: (95, 98, CE,
      ME, XP, NT, Vista), UNIX OS: (BSD UNIX, System V), Macintosh OS (MacOS)
      and Linux OS: ( Mandriva, <em>U</em>buntu, Red Hat, Caldera, Debian, and
      openSuse ).

      <strong>Functions of Operating System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every operating system performs a variety of functions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>File management</strong>: Coping or duplicating files from
          one disk to another. Keeps track of physical location of files on
          magnetic disk or other secondary storage devices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Formatting or Initialisation</strong>: Formatting a disk is a
          process of preparing a disk so that it can store data or programs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Task management</strong>: example is: 1. multitasking that is
          one user executing more than one program simultaneously or at the
          same time. 2. Multiprocessing that is one or multiple users
          simultaneously processing two or more programs by multiple computers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Managing computer resources</strong>: These programs
          coordinate all the computer&rsquo;s resources including memory, processing,
          storage, and devices such as printers and monitors (it allows the
          efficient control and use of input and output devices. This is done
          by DOS. They also monitor system performance, schedule jobs, provide
          security (maintain security by checking ID&rsquo;s and passwords etc), and
          start up the computer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>User interface</strong>: users interact with application
          programs and computer hardware through a user interface. (further
          explained later )
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Other functions</strong>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Providing error messages
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Booting</strong>; is the process of loading the Operating
          System into the computer&rsquo;s memory. In other words, is the process of
          switching on the computer and starting the operating system. Or It is
          the process of starting or resetting a computer. A booting can be
          <strong>cold</strong> or <strong>warm.</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Cold Boot or Hard reboot</strong> - is start up process that
      begins with turning on the computer's power by flipping the power switch.
      Typically, a cold boot involves some basic hardware checking by the
      system followed by loading of the operating system from disk into memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold booting prolongs the life of the computer and secures your data from
      being damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warm Boot (Reboot) or Soft reboot</strong> - is a process of
      restarting the computer that does not involve turning on the power and
      waiting for the computer to check itself and its devices or restarting a
      computer under software control.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Reason for Warm Booting/Rebooting</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For effective operation of newly installed software program. For
          instance, installation of antivirus programs, Nero program and the
          like.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Another reason that encourages warm booting is when peripheral device
          is attached to the computer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the computer freezes, it needs to be rebooted. Freezing is the
          state where all computer operations cease although the computer is
          on.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong><br></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Method of Rebooting</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three main method involved in rebooting of a computer. These
      are;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the reboot tab; to use the reboot tab, one need to go through
          these steps;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Click on the <strong>Start button</strong> on the windows task bar
          (the row at the bottom on the windows screen where all currently open
          applications or files are listed) to display the start menu.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Click on the <strong>Turn off</strong> computer button.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally, click on <strong>Restart button</strong> for the system to
          do the rebooting
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using CTRL, ALT, and DEL buttons simultaneously; the combination of
          these keys allow soft reboot
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the reset button; this is done by pressing the reset button in
          front of the system unit.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Identify two categories of operating system

      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Categories of Operating System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are hundreds of different operating systems, there are only three
      basic categories: embedded, network, and stand – alone / desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Embedded Operating Systems</strong> are used for handheld
      computers and smaller devices like PDAs. The entire operating system is
      stored permanently on the ROM chips within the device. Popular embedded
      operating system includes; Windows CE and Palm OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Network Operating System:</strong> This is a kind of operating
      system which is built to control and coordinate communication in
      computers that are networked or linked together, and mostly it is
      installed on network servers. Servers are centralized device in a network
      which helps all other computers to communicate with each other. Examples
      are; Windows NT, Windows server 2000, 2003 and 2008.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stand-alone Operating System / Desktop Operating System:</strong>
      These are built to support mini and micro computers which are mostly used
      in our homes and offices. They help users to run application and also
      control the system hardware. Examples of this operating system are; Ms
      disk Operating System, windows XP, 98, 2000, Linux, UNIX, Mac OS etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most operating systems are <strong>proprietary operating system</strong>;
      that is they are owned and licensed by a corporation. The Window
      operating system is a proprietary operating system owned by the
      <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong>. Some individuals and
      organizations have developed <strong>non- proprietary operating
      system</strong> in which the operating system program or source code is
      provided to outside individuals. These individuals are encouraged to use,
      improve, and modify the programs. Program released in this way are called
      open source. Example is Linux; ( Mandriva, <em>U</em>buntu, Red Hat,
      Caldera, Debian, and openSuse)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What an operating system does when the computer is turned
      on.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a computer is turned on a small program, called the BIOS (Basic
      Input /Output system) located in Read-Only Memory (ROM) (BIOS is a set of
      instruction stored on ROM chip that interfaces the major hardware
      components of the computer with operating system. This makes the BIOS
      neither pure hardware nor software. Is more accurately called
      <strong>firmware</strong> or software inscribe in hardware) is run. The
      BIOS runs the POST (Power-On-Self - Test), which check or manages the
      CPU, memory, disk drives, keyboard, monitor, ports and various other
      devices are functioning correctly, and then runs the bootstrap program.
      The computer <em>power-on self-test (POST)</em> tests the computer to
      make sure it meets the necessary system requirements and that all
      hardware is working properly before starting the remainder of the boot
      process. If the computer passes the POST the computer will have a single
      beep (<em>with some computer BIOS manufacturers it may beep twice</em>)
      as the computer starts and the computer will continue to start normally.
      However, if the computer fails the POST, the computer will either not
      beep at all or will generate a beep code, which tells the user the source
      of the problem
    </p>
    <p>
      The bootstrap program is responsible for loading the actual operating
      system form the hard disk into memory. The bootstrap program passes
      control to the operating system once it is loaded. The operating system
      will read configuration files, which set up the rules by which the
      operating will run, and start any software that needs to be loaded. Once
      fully awake, the system signals you that it is ready to go to work. That
      signal is what we call the <strong>prompt.</strong> The operating system
      will present the user with some way of interacting with the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some part of the operating system is automatically loaded into the RAM
      soon after you <strong>turn on</strong>, or &ldquo;<strong>boot&rdquo;</strong> the
      computer. The parts of the operating system that always remain in memory
      while the computer is on are called &ldquo;<strong>resident</strong>&rdquo;.
      Less-frequently-used parts of the operating system are copied from disk
      when needed and are called &ldquo;<strong>non-resident</strong>&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;<strong>transient</strong>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Role of the Operating System</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It provides graphical user interface for the user to interact and
          communicate with the computer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It manages the computer system&rsquo;s hardware and peripheral devices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It manages the processor, or central processing Unit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It manages and maintains the disk file systems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It supports other application programs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It provides a consistent means for software applications to work with
          the CPU.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

      <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner, you are warmly welcome to lesson 3 of Unit 2. We believe
      you enjoyed reading and solving problems on lesson 2 which looked at the
      two categories of operating system and what an operating system does.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we shall discuss user-friendly systems and user interface
      and form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Explain user-friendly operating system,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Discuss the two user interface and forms
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>User-Friendly Operating System</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many computer users have a fear that they will have to learn a somewhat
      baffling list of mysterious commands to use their computer.
      Unfortunately, a computer can be made to act in that way; the fear can be
      well founded id the operating system or application programs use commands
      and keystrokes with hidden meaning, if help is not easily available or if
      a program seems to defy a seemingly obvious operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>User-friendly</strong> is a term that implies that the computer
      somehow assists you; it provides a better means by which you can
      communicate your needs to it and by which it can guide you when
      necessary. User-friendly has acquired the popular definition of &ldquo;easy to
      learn and easy to use&rdquo; but that depends on your needs, sophisticated and
      expectation. Usually a novice may wish more helpful and computer-aided
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way in which the operating system influences the computer&rsquo;s ease of
      use is in the style of user interface provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>User Interface</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The term <strong>user interface</strong> is the means by which you are
      able to issue commands and instructions to the computer and by which the
      computer can inform you of actions you must take or errors in operation.
      Many forms of User interface exist, each with bits own sort of
      personality in terms of what it implies for your use of the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again <strong>user interface</strong>, can be also said to be the way in
      which t he computers operating system presents information to user and
      how the user gives information or instructions to the computer a swell as
      interacting and communicating with the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Functions</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It helps the user to give instructions or commands to the computer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It helps the computer to present information to the user.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It helps in shutting down the computer safely.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Types of User Interface</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically there two major types of operating system. These are;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Command Line (CL) / text interface</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Graphic User Interface (GUI)</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Command Line/ Text Interface</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes referred to as the <strong>command screen</strong>, the
      <strong>command line</strong> is a user interface that is navigated by
      typing commands at prompt, as opposed to using the mouse to perform a
      command. For example, MS-DOS (Short for <strong>Microsoft Disk operating
      system</strong>) is a command-line and is navigated by using MS-DOS
      commands. The root of MS-DOS command line prompt is generally
      <strong>C:\&gt;</strong>. In MS-DOS to view folder, you would navigate to
      the folder using the <strong><em>cd command</em></strong> and then list
      the files in that folder using the <strong><em>dir command</em></strong>.
      A command line only uses a keyboard to navigate by entering commands and
      does not utilize a mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="media/image14.jpeg" width="258" height="220">Because a command
      line interface requires unique commands, this interface is often more
      difficult to learn because of the need to memorize dozens of different
      commands. However, a command line operating system can be a very valuable
      resource and should not be ignored. For example, users who have Microsoft
      Windows may find trivial tasks such as renaming 100+ files in a folder a
      very difficult task; however, this is something that can be done in a
      matter of seconds through a simple command at the command line. Today,
      MS-DOS is no longer used; however, the command shell, more commonly known
      as the <strong>Windows command line</strong> is still used by many users.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Characteristic of Command Line/ Text interface</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prompt</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A prompt is simply a program generated signal to you that lets you know
        the system is ready for action by you. Prompts are created by both
        application program and operating systems and are one of the most
        characteristic form of the user interface. The DOS prompt seen on most
        machines using the MS-DOS or PC-DOS operating systems generally looks
        like this: C:/&gt;. The simple form of the user is said to be the
        <strong>character based</strong>, or <strong>command-line
        oriented</strong>, because it indicates to you that you are to respond
        by typing in a series of characters to issue a command to the computer.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Text</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It presents information to the user in the form of text. Command Line
        is a character based; the user need to type in special command with the
        keyboard to make things happen. The command line interface is not user
        friendly as you need to remember every word and how to use them
        correctly.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Example; c\&gt;copy c\myfile a: \yourfile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Graphic User Interface (GUI)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>GUI</strong> Short for <strong>Graphical User Interface</strong>
      is expressed as combination of text, graphics and small pictures or icons
      arranged inside windows. It is also called WIMP systems. WIMP stands for
      Windows Icons Menu Pointer. The menus are activated using a pointer which
      is moved when using a pointing device like mouse. A GUI uses
      <strong>windows</strong>, <strong>icons</strong>, and
      <strong>menu</strong> to carry out commands such as opening files,
      deleting files, moving files, etc. and although many GUI Operating
      Systems are operated by using a mouse, the keyboard can also be used by
      using keyboard shortcuts or arrow keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUI Operating Systems are much easier for end-users to learn and use
      because commands do not need to be known or memorized. Because of their
      ease of use, GUI Operating Systems have become the dominant operating
      system used by end-users today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Characteristics of Graphic User Interface (GUI)</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Icons;</strong> graphical representations for a program or
          function screen. The use of icons to symbolise actions or options has
          dramatically altered the way in which we communicate with the
          computer. Certainly the use of icons has made learning to use the
          computer more intuitive. New computer users have only to become
          accustomed to moving the mouse and selecting the proper icon for
          their task in order to become productive.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Windows;</strong> rectangular area for displaying information
        and running programs. <strong>A window</strong> is a specifically
        designed area of the screen in which may be displayed data, menus,
        programs applications, icons and other windows. The metaphor used to
        explain the windowing environment is <strong>desktop</strong>. In this
        environment, you are able to arrange your work on the computer screen
        similar to the way you might arrange on top of your actual desk. Other
        tasks represented by additional windows, would appear beneath or to one
        side or another of the current window.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Menu;</strong> provides a list of options or commands, which
          the user may choose the one he/she desire. A menu in the computer&rsquo;s
          screen is an attempt to improve the user&rsquo;s interface by providing a
          listing of commonly used commands or actions which may be selected to
          initiate a computing activity.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>

    <p>
      In this lesson we have discussed user-friendly operating system, and
      explain the concept user interface. We hope you have equipped yourself

      Dear learner, you are welcome to lesson 4 of Unit 2. In lesson 3 of Unit
      2, we discussed user-friendly operating systems and user interface with
      its characteristics. We believe you have taken notes on all the important
      features and issues discussed. Good!!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we shall discuss application software and types.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson, you will be able to;
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Application Software</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Is special computer program that has been developed, designed or written
      to solve a particular problem for users to perform useful work or
      specific tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Application software is software that has been developed to solve a
      particular problem or to perform a specific task, such as word processing
      software used to prepare documents and game software used to entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Application software can be described as the end user software designed
      to accomplish a variety of different task. It helps the user work faster,
      more efficiently and thus more productively than if the job was done
      manually. Application software may be <strong>custom</strong> or
      <strong>packaged</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Custom software or Custom Written software (special
          purpose)</strong>. Is software designed and developed for a
          particular customer. Custom software performs a task that could not
          be readily done with standard off-the-shelf packaged software
          available from a computer store or mail order house. <strong>Special-
          purpose application</strong> include thousand of other programs that
          are more narrowly focused on specific disciplines and occupations
          e.g. invoice production software, payroll system program, stock
          control program.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>User-Developed Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      As an alternative to commercially packaged software, some users write
      their own. <strong>User-written application packages</strong> are those
      that are written by developers according to t he user&rsquo;s specification. A
      user can be either an individual, such as yourself, or an organisation,
      such as business.
    </p>
    <p>
      An added advantage to writing one&rsquo;s own software is that the creator may,
      in turn, be able to market and sell it to others. What was user-written
      software to them quickly become prewritten software to us.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Packaged software or Software packaged (general
          purpose)</strong>. Is the kind of off-the-shelf program developed for
          sale to the general public. <strong>Generally software</strong> is
          developed for a wider variety of applications and meets most of the
          needs encountered by the computer user. They are also known as basic
          application. They are widely used in nearly every discipline and
          occupation. Examples of packaged software that you will most likely
          encounter are word processing programs, spreadsheet programs and
          office suites.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Prewritten, packaged software has several advantages
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The packages can be set up and running quickly; they are ready for
          immediate use. Once ready and installed on the computer, it is ready
          to use.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          They are usually less expensive that those produced in – house by the
          user company or an individual. In – house developmental costs for
          software are high because development is time consuming and requires
          skilled personnel.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pre – written software has already been tested. Any new software
          requires a great deal of testing before it is ready to use.
          Commercially produced software will not be marketed successfully if
          the buying audience is not convinced that the software is reliable
          and efficient. The testing of the software package begins inside the
          developer&rsquo;s own organization
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Shareware</strong> (software made available for free trial with
      the understanding that the user will voluntarily pay a fee to the author
      or publisher for continuous use) is one avenue for acquiring software. A
      software developer owns the rights to the software but elects to
      distribute free of charge or for a nominal fee. <strong>Public domain
      software</strong> earns its name from the fact that the developers have
      given up their rights to the software, or because it was produced from
      public funds, such as university research project underwritten by a
      government grant. This software is distributed free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unauthorised</strong> copying and distribution of software is
      illegal. It is also an unethical use of the software to which you have
      access. When an author creates a book, such as the one you are reading,
      the author can obtain a copyright, which provides legal protection
      against unauthorised copying or use of the author&rsquo;s work. Similarly,
      computer software can be protected legally by a copyright, which
      establishes a limitation on how a person may legally use the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, you are given the right to use the software on one
      computer and to make a single <strong>archival copy</strong> of the
      software as a backup to guard against accidental loss. Sometimes a
      software company will grant the buyer the right to use the software on
      more than one computer, <strong>a site license</strong>, for example the
      right to use the software on all computers installed at a single location
      or within a company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although you may &ldquo;get away&rdquo; with making copy for a friend, you really are
      breaking the law, unless the software you are using is public domain
      software or share software that gives you the right to copy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we have discussed that application package can be grouped
      into two broad categories: specialised and generalised. A specialised
      application package performs a specific task and cannot be changed or
      programmed to perform a different task. A generalised application package
      is the one that can be applied to a variety of tasks.

      <strong>Productivity Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are software designed purposely for generally use. Examples are;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Word Processing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      At some time, you have been required handwrite or type a long term paper
      or similar document; and you know just how time consuming editing and
      rewriting the text can be. A word processor can make the job simpler,
      easier and faster. A word processor is software that lets the user edit,
      manipulate, and print text. It automates many tasks associated with
      writing in longhand and typing, such as cutting and pasting, cantering
      and setting margins. WordStar, MultiMate Advantage and WordPerfect are
      three of t e most popular word processors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Managers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The demand that data and information be organised and accessible in
      different formats has exceeded what can be done manually in a reasonable
      amount of time. Data managers were developed in answer to this demand.
      Data managers stores, organises, manipulate, retrieve, display and print
      data. The term data manager describes file management systems and
      database management systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      A file <em>management system</em> is a program that stores, manipulate
      and prints data stored in separate files. A <em>database management</em>
      system is a program that stores, manipulate and prints data in a
      database. In a database, data from more than one file can be accessed at
      the same time. At home you might use data managers to itemise valuable
      personal items or to list address and phone numbers of friends, relatives
      or business contacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Electronic Spreadsheets</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A spreadsheet program is software that displays, manipulates and prints
      rows and columns of data. It is similar to a paper spreadsheet in that
      both columns and rows in which data are labelled and entered. The
      difference lies in the fact that data in an electronic spreadsheet are
      then recalculated automatically and the results stored. Electronic
      spreadsheets can perform a lot of takes from budgeting personal income to
      financial planning for a corporation. Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel, is
      some of the popular spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Graphic Packages</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphic packages display data visually in the form of graphic images. For
      example someone using a spreadsheet or data manager to manipulate and
      organise data may find it difficult to see relationships or interpret the
      information. Presenting the information visually (graphically) is one way
      to make the task easier. One type of graphic package can extract and
      display data graphically in line, pie, or bar charts. Business managers
      use graphic packages to present statistics and other data and their
      relationships to staff or to client. At home you could use graphics to
      create a bar chart that shows if your monthly spending varied from your
      budget. Graphic packages are available that enable the artist to draw
      pictures and engineers to create designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Presentation Graphics</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another form of graphic software of one that assists in preparing
      materials for presentation purposes–slides and handouts for speakers or
      instructors. Microsoft&rsquo;s power point ca use input from a variety of
      sources including video images and computer – created art, which can then
      be combined with texts and other images. Outputs from these programs can
      be to photographic slides, printed outputs, or video projection device
      for a computer aided presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Speciality Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      They mostly use for unique production. These are;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Desktop publishing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a concept that combines the use of a microcomputer with word
      processor, page combination and graphics software, and high quality laser
      printers to create newsletters, magazines and other publications.
      Page-composition software as PageMaker has been developed for both MS-DOS
      system using Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh. Anyone can use such a
      system to create and publish documents, for example, departments within
      corporations that want to publish in-house, small businesses, small
      magazine publishers and writers who like the idea of self-publishing,
      booklets, brochures, newsletters and annual reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Communication Packages</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      As more individuals and companies use computers, the need to transfer
      data from one computer to another has increased. Law enforcement agencies
      exchange information on criminals, home users access information services
      such as CompuServe or Prodigy and some individuals and business send
      electronic mail. To facilitate such communication between computers,
      communication packages such as Pro-Com are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Educational Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any software that is used in teaching and learning. Some educational
      software includes, Encarta, Encyclopaedia, Software dictionaries,
      Educational software facilitates teaching and learning. Some have been
      designed to keep the learner in suspense and motivated to arrive at the
      correct answer. In most of this educational software he learner is given
      feedback on performance as her or she moves from one stage to the other.
      Educational software usually makes use of multimedia elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of this software includes the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          it serves as a research materials
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          it serves as a teaching and learning material
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          it promotes self pace learning
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Integrated Packages (All-in-One Solutions)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Integrated software allows several programs to share the same data. For
      examples, a graphic package can sue data directly from spreadsheet file
      to draw a graph. Integration also implies similar functions and a common
      set of commands and keystrokes among programs. In reality, however, this
      happens in varying degrees. Nevertheless, the result of integration is
      that, the user can work faster, more efficiently and thus more
      productively, than if non-integrated programs were used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner, you have learnt in this lesson the categories of
      application software with examples. As well as, integrated packages
      (All-in-One).

    <p>
      Once again, you are welcome to lesson 6 of Unit 2. In this lesson, we
      shall look at the ways in which computers communicate. In addition we
      shall discuss the difference between digital and analog data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

    <p>
      <strong>Communication</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the simplest way to explain communication is giving and receiving
      information. For communication to exist there should be perfect
      connection and understanding of all the objects and gargets involved. The
      most important thing to consider in communication is that there should be
      sharing of resources and information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer <strong>communications</strong> is the process of sharing data,
      programs, and information between two or more computers. OR
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Communication</strong>; is the process of
      <strong>sending</strong> and <strong>receiving</strong> information
      through a communication channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are numerous applications that depend on communication systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>E-mail –</strong> provides a fast, efficient alternative to
          traditional mail by sending and receiving electronic documents.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Instant messaging –</strong> supports direct, &ldquo;live&rdquo;
          electronic communication between two or more friends.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Internet telephone –</strong> provide a very low cost
          alternative to long distance telephone calls using electronic voice
          delivery.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Electronic commerce –</strong> buying and selling goods
          electronically
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Communication</strong>; is the process of sending data from
      one point to another through a communication channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of using communication facilities such as the telephone
      system and microwave relays to send data between computers in a form of
      data communication referred to as <strong>telecommunication</strong> or
      <strong>teleprocessing.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand data communication and networking, you should first be
      familiar with the terms and technical side of t he subject. He two forms
      of data communication are <strong>analog</strong> and
      <strong>digital.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Form of Data Transmission</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Analog data transmission</strong> is the passage of data in a
      continuous wave form. The telephone system is based on analog
      transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="media/image15.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      Analog Data Transmission
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Digital data transmission</strong> is the passage of data using
      distinct on and off electrical state, and therefore represented by 0s and
      1s. Recall that the data in a digital form are represented as either on
      (1) or off (0). Because the computer &ldquo;understands&rdquo; and works in digital
      form. The Computer understands and uses digital data. It would seem that
      all data communication between computers would be in digital form; but
      that is not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Total digital transmission is possible and is growing, however, the
      telephone system, designed as an analog is used for a great percentage of
      data communication, because it is the largest and widely used
      communication system in place. Because of the expensive involved in
      converting to a digital system or running a duplicate digital system, a
      method was developed that allows digital signals to be transmitted over
      telephone lines. The process is called
      <strong>modulation-demodulation</strong>.

      <strong>Connecting Device</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      These devices act as an interface between the sending and receiving
      devices and the communication channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal of computer communication takes place over telephone lines.
      However, because the telephone was originally designed for voice
      transmission, telephones typically send and receive <strong>analog
      signals</strong>, which are continuously electronic waves. Computers, in
      contrast, send and receive <strong>digital signals.</strong> These
      represent the presence of an electronic pulse – the on/off binary signals
      we mentioned earlier. To convert the digital to analog signals and vice
      versa, you need a modem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Modem</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Modem stands for <strong>Modulator and Demodulator</strong>. It is a
      communication device/equipment used to convert data in digital form to
      analog form so that it (data) can be carried over the telephone line and
      vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of converting digital signal to analog signal is called
      <strong>modulation. Demodulation</strong> is the process of reconverting
      the analog signal back to a digital signal. The modem enables digital
      microcomputers to communicate across analog telephone lines. This
      communication includes both voice and data communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed with which modems transmit data varies. This speed, called
      <strong>transfer speed or</strong> <strong>transfer rate</strong>, is
      typically measured in <strong>bits per second (bps).</strong> The higher
      the speed, the faster you can send and receive information. For example,
      transferring an image might take 75 seconds with a 33.6 kbps modem and
      only 45 seconds with a 56kbps modem. The modem speed is measured in
      <strong>bit per second (BPS).</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Types of Modem</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four basic types of modems: external, internal, PC Card, and
      wireless.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>external modem</strong> stands apart from the computer
          and typically is connected by a cable to the computer&rsquo;s serial port.
          Another cable connects the modem to the telephone wall jack.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>internal modem</strong> consists of a plug in circuit
          board inside the system unit. A telephone cable connects the modem to
          the telephone wall jack.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>PC card</strong> modem is a credit card-size expansion
          board that is inserted into portable computers. A telephone cable
          connects the modem to the telephone wall jack.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <strong>wireless modem</strong> may be internal, external, or PC
          card. Unlike the other modems, it does not use cables. Instead,
          wireless modems send and receive through the air.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most external direct-connect modems have variety of features including
      the ability to handle these activities.

      <strong>What is Communication Network?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Communication</strong> <strong>network</strong> is a collection
      of computers and other equipment organized to share data, information,
      hardware and software through a communication channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer</strong> <strong>Network</strong>: This is a system in
      which a number of independent computers are linked together to share
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Internet (international networking)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Internet</strong> is global collection of high – powered
      computers that are connected to each other with connection medium, using
      rules and procedures that guide the formatting and transmission of data
      between computers defined by the protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Internet Concept and Terminology</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following components are needed for the internet to work effectively.

    <p>
      <strong>Protocol</strong>; the rules for exchanging data between
      computers in a network (i.e. they determined how communications are
      across a network).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet protocol
      (TCP/IP)</strong>; is a set of rules that an application can use to
      package its information for sending across the network(s). TCP is
      responsible for breaking up large batch of data into little data packets.
      IP is responsible for packing the destination address information in
      these packets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Routers</strong>; are specialized computers that read the
      addresses of <strong>packets</strong> and direct the packets to their
      destinations. Always the router checks for traffic and determines the
      best path before it sends the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Domain Name</strong>; describes organization or geographic
      realities. They either indicate the country the network connection is in,
      or what organization owns it and sometime further details. A computer
      that translates the domain name of another computer into an IP address,
      and vice versa, upon request is known as DNS Server. Examples are;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          com - commercial
        </p>

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          org - usually private organizations and others
        </p>

          in - India.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ISPs are providers who are already connected to the internet and
      provide a path or connection for individual to access the internet. A
      user buys a subscription to a service provider which gives the user an
      identifying user name and password and a telephone number. Some service
      provider limit the amount of time a user can spend on the internet.
      Examples of ISPs are; Africa online, CompuServe, MSN, AT&amp;T, WorldNet,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Connecting to the Internet</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dial-up connections</strong>; this is connecting to an internet
      host through a modem and standard telephone lines. The data is stored on
      the host computer and not on your computer. It operates on the same
      principle as making phone call. With dial-up your modem makes a call to
      ISP to gain internet connection before you can browse. This connection is
      slow as compared to broadband connection. <strong>ADSL (asymmetric
      digital subscriber line)</strong> is one of the most widely used types of
      DSL. This technology is widely available in most areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Broadband connections</strong>; The broadband connection offer
      data transmission speed comparable to direct connection speeds. Broadband
      connections are always on; you don&rsquo;t need to dial in. The internet is
      instantly available anytime, like TV or radio. Broadband is base on these
      technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>DSL (digital subscriber line).</strong> Is a technology for
          bringing high-bandwidth connections to homes and small business over
          ordinary copper telephone lines. DSL customers must be geographically
          close to phone company service hubs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cable modem connection</strong>. Cable modems come from TV
          companies. Sometimes this connection is slow because a single cable
          may be shared by an entire neighborhood so when users goes up, speeds
          can go down.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Satellite connection</strong>. This is available through many
          of the same satellite dishes that provide television channels to
          viewers.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Direct connection</strong>; this connection is connecting
      directly with the ISP server. When you are directly connected your files
      are stored on your computer, not on a remote host; and response time is
      much faster.

          <strong>Wireless broadband connection.</strong> This is where a
          computer is connected to the internet without cables, but through
          short-range radio waves. To access the network your laptop or
          computer must have a wireless PC card installed.

    <p>
      <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      World Wide Web (WWW, W3, or Web); is actually the superset of the
      internet. It is part of the internet which supports a huge collection of
      &ldquo;pages&rdquo; of information linked to each other around the globe. Each page
      can have many links that take you to new destination. Web pages can be
      linked to other pages anywhere in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Web browser</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to surf the internet, you will need a software program called a
      <strong>web browser.</strong> A web browser is software that allows users
      to access, read and view any document on the web. That is software for
      viewing web pages or software that enables users to lunch the internet
      onto their computer. It is your gateway to the World Wide Web (www). The
      web browser looks much like the program for writing letters and reports.
      However, with a web browser, you cannot actually edit the information it
      displays. You can only read, save, or print out what you see on the
      screen. There are a number of web browsers that users can use to access
      the web. The popular ones are:

    <p>
      <strong><br></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uses of Browsers</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It allows user to access used information on the web server.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It downloads information over phone lines to a user computer
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It creates illusion of travelling to an actual location in visual
          space when the document being viewed exists
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Display a variety of test and graphics that may be integrated into
          such a document including animation audio or video
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Web page:</strong> Is a single unit of information, often called
      a document which is available via the World Wide Web. The web pages are
      viewed using an application called <strong>web browser</strong>. e.g.
      internet explorer. Documents on web pages are called
      <strong>hypertext</strong> if the media is text only or
      <strong>hypermedia</strong> if the media includes graphics as well as
      text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hyperlinks</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using hyperlinks to move from one place to another is one of the most
      common activities on the World Wide Web. To find a link on the page, look
      for text that is displayed in a different colour or image. When the text
      or the image is a hyperlink the cursor changes to a human hand when move
      over it. By default, hyperlinks that are text and have not been used are
      blue. Links you have already visited are purple. These colours can be
      changed, however. To open a link, place the mouse pointer over the
      hyperlink and click. There will be a short delay after you click on the
      hyperlink.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Web site</strong>: Is a collection of web pages created and
      maintained by organisations, educational institutions, businesses and
      individuals. Basically, a group of web pages are called <strong>Web
      sites.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is a standardised codes or tags that are used to define the
      structure of information on a web page. Web pages (documents) are written
      in a language called <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong>.
      An html source document is a text file that includes codes that describe
      the format, layout and logical structure of a hypermedia document on a
      web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Http is a set of rules or protocol, which govern the transfer of
      hypertext between two or more computers. That is the protocol for
      transferring web pages or exchanging information over the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every web site has a unique address called a URL. The URL is a string of
      letters or numbers that help to locate a particular website for
      information on the web. It identifies a particular internet resource for
      example a web page, an image or a text file. The URL for the Cable News
      Network web site is http://www.cnn.com. The URL http://www.uew.edu.gh is
      the website address for University of Education Winneba.
    </p>
    <p>
      The format of the URL <em>http:/ /www.cnn.com/showbiz /movies.htm</em> is
      shown below: The first part &lsquo;http&rsquo; is the <strong>Protocol</strong>, the
      second part &lsquo;www.cnn.com&rsquo; is the <strong>Host</strong> (web server name
      and Domain name), the third part &lsquo;showbiz&rsquo; is the <strong>Path</strong>
      (Folder name), the last part &lsquo;movies.htm&rsquo; is the <strong>Filename and
      filename extension</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      http : / / www.cnn.com / showbiz / movies.htm
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Protocol</strong></em> <em><strong>Host</strong></em> (web
      server name and domain name) <em><strong>Path</strong></em> (folder name)
      <em><strong>Filename and filename extension</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      File Transfer Protocol (FTP); is an Internet standard for transferring
      files from one computer to another. Many computers on the Internet allow
      you to copy file to your computer. This is called
      <strong>downloading</strong>. You can use FTP to copy files from your
      computer to another computer on the internet. This is called
      <strong>uploading</strong>. FTP is used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Promote sharing of files (computer programs and or data).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Transfer data reliably, and efficiently.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Internet Address</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to communicate across the Internet, a computer must have a
      unique address, that unique numeric identifier or address is called an
      <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) address</strong>. IP address: is an
      identifier for a particular machine on a particular network. Each IP
      address consist of two parts, the network address and host address. The
      network address identifies the entire network. Each machine on the same
      network shares that network address as part of its IP address. The host
      address identifies a particular machine on the network. This how
      individual users are identified to receive file transfer, e-mail
      messages, and file requests. The IP address a set of four numbers (32
      bits) separated by period (a dot). The numbers ranges between 0 and 255.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Characteristics of IP Address</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          IP address are unique
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          No two machines can have the same IP number
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          IP address are also global and standardised
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All machines connected to the internet agree to use the same scheme
          for establishing an address.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          IP addresses work well for communication between computers but people
          often have difficulty remembering a series of numbers. As a result,
          many host computers have easy-to-remember names that translate
          directly to the computer&rsquo;s IP address. These names are called URL.

      <strong>Major Features of Internet</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Discussion groups; you can use email to communicate in <strong>discussion
      groups</strong> with people you do not know but with whom you wish to
      share ideas and interests. Discussion groups include;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Newsgroups</strong>; it&rsquo;s one of the internet based services
          which include thousands of news groups. Each new group hold
          discussion on specific topic and the news groups&rsquo; indicates its
          users. To participate in the news group one need a news reader
          program.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Internet Relay Chat</strong> (<strong>IRC</strong>); this
          software is available free from several locations on the internet.
          Using client- chart software, you log on the server, select topic in
          which you are interested, and begin chatting. To participate, you
          need access to server that supports IRC. This is done using special
          chart- client software.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Telnet</strong>; is an internet standard that allows you to
          connect to another computer (host) on the internet and to log on to
          that computer as if you were on a terminal in the next room. There
          are hundreds of computers on the internet that you can connect to.
          Some allow limited free access, and others charge fee for their use.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>E- mail</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      People normally connect to the internet because of the communication
      access it provides. The basic communication tool of the internet is
      e-mail. The e-mail stands for <em>electronic mail</em>. It is a means of
      sending and receiving information between computers on the internet. The
      basic structure of an e-mail address in oct@yahoo.edu
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          &ldquo;oce&rdquo; is the user ID or Username.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          &ldquo;@&rdquo; the symbol is pronounced &lsquo;AT&rsquo;.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Yahoo&rdquo; is name of the company or the computer (server) that
          maintains the mailbox. Yahoo.edu is the domain name.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          &ldquo;.edu&rdquo; describes the type of the organization and this is education.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>How the data travels on the internet</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a message is sent on internet, the message is broken into small
      pieces called &ldquo;<strong>packets</strong>&rdquo;. Packets are the basic unit of
      measurement on the Internet. There are special purpose computers called
      &ldquo;Routers&rdquo; on the internet, which decide what is the best path to the
      destination to send these packets. Once these packets reach their
      destination they are reassembled into the original message.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uses of Internet</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet could be use for the following:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <strong>Search Engine</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Web search engines are special software programmes that may be used to
      search for information on the Internet.. This means that a search engine
      is able to help you obtain the information that you are looking for on
      the world wide web, The search results are usually presented in a list of
      results and are commonly called <em><strong>hits.</strong></em> Search
      engines are very vital for students and teachers and indeed all who use
      the Internet. The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or Internet addresses of
      some search engines are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          http://www.google.com

      <strong>Searching Information on the Internet</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ways of searching:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>

      <strong>Types of network</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember we&rsquo;ve explain network as a group of computers contenting
      together to share resources, and information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Local Area Networks (LANs)</strong>: These systems designed
          connect computers in relatively close proximity. Typically LANs are
          owned and operated by individual organizations such as colleges,
          universities, private or government organization. LANs provide two
          benefits:
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Economic</strong> - people can share costly equipment
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flexibility</strong> - other equipment, microcomputer can be to
      the LAN.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)</strong>: these networks
          are frequently used as links between office buildings in a city. For
          example, many organizations use MANs to connect their office
          buildings located throughout a city. Unlike a LAN, a MAN is typically
          not owned by a single organization. Rather, it is either owned by a
          group of organizations who jointly own and operate the network or by
          a single network service provider who provides network services for a
          fee. Cellular phone systems expand the flexibility of MANs by
          allowing links to car phones and portable phones.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Wide Area Networks (WANs)</strong>: these networks are
          countrywide and worldwide networks. These networks provide access to
          regional service (MAN) providers and typically span distances greater
          than 100 miles. They use microwave relays and satellites to reach
          users over long distance. The widest of all WANs, is the internet,
          which spans the entire globe.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The primary difference between a LAN, MAN, and WAN is the geographical
      range. Each may have various combinations of hardware, such as
      microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframe and various peripheral devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Networking in School:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the connection where computers within a school can share data,
      information and other resources. In other cases, the connection is
      extended to other schools within a specific geographical area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uses of networking in the classroom
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It enable users to share common hardware resources, e.g. printer
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Improves collaborative learning, such as company database
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It gives freedom to users regarding where they want to use their PCs
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Wireless Area Network:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wireless connection allows user to connect their computer and communicate
      without physical cables. Wireless connection is common in school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wireless connection includes;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Microwave station;
        </p>

      <strong>What is Computer Security?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is defined as techniques developed to safeguard the computer and
      information systems stored in the computer (the method of protecting
      data, programs and hardware.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a techniques developed to protect computers and network linked
      computers systems from accidental or intentional harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What is Computer Security Risk?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is any event or action that can cause a loss of or damage to computer
      equipment, software, data and information, or processing capability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the threat to computer security is destruction of computer hardware
      and software, theft, unauthorized use, observation, or disclosure of
      computer data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer and the information they contain are often considered
      confidential systems because their use is typically restricted to a
      limited number of users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let look at some of the threat to computer systems such as; hardware,
      software and peoples.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer Hardware Threats</strong>; these are harmful event that
      occur to the computer&rsquo;s hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer threats include:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Theft</strong>: people steal parts of the computer like CD
          ROM drive, memory card etc to sell or use it fix other damaged
          computers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Dust</strong>: the accumulation of dust inside the computer
          begins to temper with the proper functioning of the electric circuit
          in the computer. It also blocks the air supply to some of the
          computer components such as CPU and fan which makes the computer heat
          up quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Power fluctuation/Electrical faults:</strong> due to power
          fluctuation or continuous power cut, it reduces the lifespan of the
          computer by gradually destroying the hard disk.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Rodent/insects</strong>: rodents like mouse can chew the data
          cables in the system unit which will prevent it from booting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Liquids</strong>: spillage of liquids such as water on the
          computer can cause rust of the some component and will prevent proper
          functioning of the computer.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Protecting the computer from power fluctuation/electrical
      faults</strong>
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Using surge protector</strong>: Is an appliance designed to
          protect electrical devices from power surges or over voltage that is
          when the power is increases above the normal volts and under voltage
          when the power drops below the normal volts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Using uninterruptible power supply (UPS)</strong>: Is a
          device or battery that provides power when the primary source power
          is unavailable. This stores power so when the source power is lost
          UPS provides power for some minutes so that you save your work and
          shut down your system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Using Voltage stabilizer</strong>: Is an electrical regulator
          designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage level for your
          device.

      <strong>Encryption</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another technique to protect confidential information is encryption.
      Computer users can scramble information to prevent unauthorized users
      from accessing it. Authorized users can unscramble the information when
      needed by using a secret code called a key. Without the key the scrambled
      information would be impossible or very difficult to unscramble.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Passwords</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Passwords are confidential sequences of characters that allow approved
      persons to make use of specified computers, software, or information. To
      be effective, passwords must be difficult to guess and should not be
      found in dictionaries. Effective passwords contain a variety of
      characters and symbols that are not part of the alphabet
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Firewalls</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A firewall is software or hardware that checks information coming from
      the Internet or a network, and then either blocks it or allows it to pass
      through to your computer, depending on your firewall settings. A firewall
      can help prevent hackers or malicious software (such as worms) from
      gaining access to your computer through a network or the Internet.
    </p>

      <strong>Approved Users</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another technique to help prevent abuse and misuse of computer data is to
      limit the use of computers and data files to approved persons. Security
      software can verify the identity of computer users and limit their
      privileges to use, view, and alter files. The software also securely
      records their actions to establish accountability. Some of things that
      can be used to restrict users&rsquo; access are;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Logon:</strong> combination of unique user name and Password.
          This prevent unauthorized user from logging on into the computer
          system.

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Biometric:</strong> scanning devices such as fingerprint, and
          retinal (eye) Scanners can be used to check the true identity of a
          user before he is allowed access.

      <strong>Activity 1</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you have heard the term <strong>virus</strong> before. Can you
      briefly explain it?
    </p>
    <p>
      ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
    </p>
    <p>
      May be your definition might be either of the following
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer Virus;</strong> Is a hidden set of instructions
      (software) buried in another set of instructions (software) with the
      ability to move from one computer to another causing damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virus is a computer program that replicates itself and transfers itself
      to another computer system. Virus is a kind of malicious code (program)
      that cause damage to programs and make the system crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virus is also a computer program that is part of another and inserts
      copies of itself, often damaging the integrity of stored data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer virus travels with the program that contains it, and it cannot
      infect human being since it is electronic instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two categories of viruses <strong>Benign</strong> and then
      <strong>Malignant.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first category of virus (<strong>benign</strong>) displays a message
      or slows down your computer but does not destroy any information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Malignant</strong> virus, however, do damage to the computer
      system. Some will scramble or delete your files. Others shut your
      computer down, make your word software act strangely or damage the
      compact flash memory in your digital camera so that it will not store
      pictures any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><br></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Examples of viruses</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Boot sector or partition table virus:</strong> Boot sector is
          the area of the computer that is accessed when the computer is turned
          on. This type of virus attack the booting portion of the operating
          system on the computer thereby destroying the operating system. When
          this happens the user may need to reinstall the operating system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Worm</strong> is a program that multiplies on its own to make
          numerous copies of itself. Worms slow down the computer making it
          difficult to work with.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Trojan Horses</strong> look like very useful programs but
          only end up destroying the files on the computer. This type of virus
          does not reproduce themselves like worms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Resident Viruses:</strong> This type of virus dwells in the
          RAM memory. It interrupts all of the operations executed by the
          system by corrupting files and programs that are opened, closed,
          copied, renamed etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Direct Action Viruses:</strong> The main purpose of this
          virus is to replicate and take action when it is executed. When a
          specific condition is met, the virus will go into action and infect
          files in the directory or folder that it is in and in directories
          that are specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file PATH.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Overwrite Viruses:</strong> Virus of this kind is
          characterized by the fact that it deletes the information contained
          in the files that it infects, rendering them partially or totally
          useless once they have been infected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Macro Virus:</strong> Macro viruses infect files that are
          created using certain applications or programs that contain macros.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Directory Virus:</strong> Directory viruses change the paths
          that indicate the location of a file. By executing a program (file
          with the extension .EXE or .COM) which has been infected by a virus,
          you are unknowingly running the virus program, while the original
          file and program have been previously moved by the virus.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Polymorphic Viruses:</strong> Polymorphic viruses encrypt or
          encode themselves in a different way (using different algorithms and
          encryption keys) every time they infect a system. This makes it
          impossible for anti-viruses to find them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Companion Viruses:</strong> They are known as companion
          viruses because once they get into the system they "accompany" the
          other files that already exist.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>FAT Virus:</strong> The file allocation table or FAT is the
          part of a disk used to connect information and is a vital part of the
          normal functioning of the computer. This type of virus attack can be
          especially dangerous, by preventing access to certain sections of the
          disk where important files are stored.

    <p>
      <strong>How Viruses may Affect Files</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viruses can affect any files; however, usually attack <strong>.com, .exe,
      .sys, .bin, .pif or any data files</strong> - Viruses have the capability
      of infecting any file; however, will generally infect executable files or
      data files, such as word or excel documents that are opened frequently
      and allow the virus to try infecting other files more often.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Increase the files size</strong> - When infecting files, virtues
      will generally increase the size of the file; however, with more
      sophisticated viruses these changes can be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It can delete files as the file is run</strong> - Because most
      files are loaded into memory, once the program is in memory the virus can
      delete the file used to execute the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It can corrupt files randomly</strong> - Some destructive viruses
      are not designed to destroy random data but instead randomly delete or
      corrupt files.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It can cause write protect errors when executing .exe files from
      a write protected disk</strong> - Viruses may need to write themselves to
      files that are executed; because of this, if a diskette is write
      protected, you may receive a write protection error.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It can convert .exe files to .com files</strong> - Viruses may
      use a separate file to run the program and rename the original file to
      another extension so the exe is run before the com.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It can reboot the computer when executed</strong> - Numerous
      computer viruses have been designed to cause a computer to reboot,
      freeze, or perform other tasks not normally exhibited by the computer.

      <strong>Threat to Computer Users</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the benefits of computer technology comes the potential for
      unwelcome side effects. For people who work long hour with computers, the
      side effects include bad posture and bad vision and other health related
      problems due to radiation emissions, repetitive-stress injuries,
      eyestrain and headache and back and neck pains. As a result of this,
      there has been a great interest in a field known as
      <strong>ergonomics.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ergonomics</strong> (sometimes called human engineering) is the
      science that studies the factors relating to things that people use.
      Ergonomic studies suggest preventative measures you can take to protect
      your health as you work with computers.
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Choose equipment that&rsquo;s ergonomically designed.</strong> When
          you are buying computer equipment look beyond functionality. Use
          magazine reviews, manufacturer&rsquo;s information, and personal research
          to check on health-related factors such as monitor radiation and
          glare, disk-drive noise level and keyboard layout.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create a healthy workspace</strong>. Keep the paper copy of
          your work at close to the same height as your screen. Position your
          monitor and lights to minimize glare. Sit at arm&rsquo;s length from your
          monitor to minimize radiation risks. Align your body so that your
          head is supported by your spine; don&rsquo;t slouch or lean forward. Feet
          on the floor, and elbows at a 90 degree angle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Build flexibility into your work environment</strong>.
          Whenever possible work with an adjustable table and monitor and a
          removable keyboard, change your work position
          frequently.<strong>.</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Rest your eyes</strong>. Look up from the screen periodically
          and focus on a far away object or scene. Blink your eyes frequently.
          Take a 15-minute break from using the video display unit (VDU) every
          2 hours. Your eyes should be at least one and a half to two feet from
          your monitor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>When tired refresh yourself with some exercise</strong>. Do
          some simple stretches to loosen tight muscles. Occasional stretching
          of the muscles in your arms, hands, wrist, back, shoulders and lower
          body can make hours of computer work more comfortable and less
          harmful.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use optical glass monitor filter</strong>. This reduces the
          risk of radiation emissions from the display unit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Room should be well ventilated and there should be a good lighting
          system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Seek help when you need it</strong>. When you are having
          persistent problem that may be related to excessive computer work,
          talk to a professional or a medical doctor may be able to help you
          before it becomes chronic.

      <strong>System Failure</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A system failure is a sudden computer malfunction as a result of
      electrical power problems, hardware component such as disk drive failure,
      or software or program error resulting in the loss of all save and
      unsaved data.
    </p>
    <p>
      An under voltage occurs when the electrical power supply drops. An over
      voltage, or power surge, occurs when the incoming electrical power
      increases significantly above the normal 120 volts. A surge protector
      keeps an over voltage from damaging computer equipment. With electrical
      power fluctuation, UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Backup Procedures</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Backup is a duplicate of a file, program, which can be used if the
      original is lost, damaged, or destroyed. Files can be restored by copying
      the backed up files to their original location on the computer. Backup
      copies should be kept in fireproof and heatproof safe or offsite in order
      to prevent it from stolen or catching fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storing backup copies of software and data and having backup computer and
      communication capabilities are important basic safeguards because the
      data can then be restored if it was altered or destroyed by a computer
      crime or accident such as natural hazards; fires, floods, hurricanes,
      tornadoes and earthquakes are all natural hazards that can lead to
      destruction of the computer system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civil strike and terrorism; wars, riots, student demonstration and
      terrorism are real risk in every country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Three Types of Backup that can be Performed are</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Full backup</strong>, which copies all of the files in the
          computer.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Differential backup</strong>, which copies only the files
          that have changed since the last full backup.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Incremental backup</strong>, which copies only the files that
          have changed since the last full or last incremental backup.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Some users implement a three-generation backup procedure to
      preserve three copies of important files.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>grandparent</strong> is the oldest copy of the file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>parent</strong> is the second oldest copy of the file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>child</strong> is the most recent copy of the file.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="section-4"></h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Why do you need to back up your computer?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing that you store on your computer is information.
      Often the contents of a hard disk can represent years of work. If the
      hard disk stops working one day you could lose all those years of work.
      For this reason it is VITAL that you take regular backups of the
      information that is stored on the computer. Back ups are done against
      viruses, and unforeseen circumstances being it natural disasters, theft
      etc. In large organizations this backup procedure is normally performed
      automatically by your computer support team, where the data is normally
      held on a centralized, networked computer.

      <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner, once again welcome to another lesson 3 of unit 3. In this
      lesson we shall be discussing Multimedia, elements of multimedia and then
      multimedia applications. Though the term seem to be unfamiliar to you,
      but then do not be afraid, relax and read on and you will be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectives</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the lesson you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
      <li>
        <p>
          Explain the meaning of multimedia
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          State and explain at least thee elements of multimedia
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When you sit at the back of your television, sometimes you watch adverts
      or musical clips. In the case of the advertisement, you realised that a
      message is being put across using different means as possible. Again when
      you watch a musical clip, a message is also sent across using different
      means e.g. slow dancing, different picture background etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What is Multimedia?</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It means being able to communicate in more than one way for better
          interaction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Integration of all sort of media elements into one presentation
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Execution of text, graphics, sound, and animation simultaneously in a
          presentation.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Effective multimedia presentations incorporate user participation or
      interactivity. <strong>Interactivity</strong> allows the user to choose
      the information to view, control the pace and flow of information, and to
      respond to items and receive feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act of responding to question posed by multimedia system is
      <strong>interactivity</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Elements of Multimedia</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are five main elements which make up a typical multimedia program.
      They are:
    </p>
    <p>
      Text, sound/audio, graphics, animation and video.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Text</strong> includes characters used to create word,
          sentences, and paragraphs which are aimed at presenting information
          to your audience or students. The use of different styles, fonts and
          colours can be used to emphasize specific words or phrases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Graphics</strong> are digital representation of information
          other than text. For example drawing, chat, photograph, pictures or
          image. Some of these contain no movements or animation. Graphic can
          illustrate certain concepts more vividly than text and therefore play
          an important role in teaching and learning. Most people retain a
          higher percentage of materials they see graphically. Most software
          applications used today are graphic based.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Animation</strong> is a graphic that has the illusion of
          motion. They can convey information more vividly than text. It is
          achieved by displaying a series of still graphics. They range from
          basic graphic with simple motion to a detailed image with complex
          movements. They are used to provide better illustration about how
          certain devices, equipment, system and phenomena work more than text
          can do. It is used in a variety of ways to improve the quality and
          make both educational software and website more fascinating.
          Animation is measured in frame per second, (fps).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Video</strong> is a combination of text, graphics and images
          and sound with visual effect to present information. Students can be
          made to dramatize a situation or an event based on a topic especially
          those that centres on morality and self conduct and this could be
          incorporated in a multimedia.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Sounds/Audio:</strong> Sound can be added to a multimedia
          presentation from a variety of sources. Original sounds can be
          recorded using a microphone and programs such as Hyper Studio, Movie
          Works, or Smart Sound. These applications, as well as QuickTime Pro,
          can also be used to import sounds from an audio CD or the Internet.

      <strong>Computer Based Training (CBT)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      An interactive instructional approach in which the computer, taking the
      place of an instructor, provides a series of stimuli to the student
      ranging from questions to be answered to choices or decisions to be made.
      The CBT then provides feedback based on the student&rsquo;s response. It can be
      looked at the use of a computer as teaching machine to deliver
      instruction. CBT in recent years has become supplanted by web – based
      training (WBT). CBT now generally refers to off – line, stand – alone
      instruction delivered by computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the increase in <em>PC</em> <em>computing</em> power, and
      especially the growing prevalence of <em>computers</em> equipped with
      <em>CD-ROMs,</em> is making CBT a more viable <em>option</em> for
      corporations and individuals alike. Many PC applications now come with
      some modest form of CBT, often called a tutorial. Typical example is
      Mavis Beacon
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Web-Based Training (WBT)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A form of computer – based training in which the training materials
      resides on the web pages accessible through the World Wide Web. Typical
      media elements used are text and graphics. Other media such as animation,
      audio, and video can be used, but require more bandwidth and in some
      cases additional software. The terms &ldquo;online courses&rdquo; and &ldquo;web-based
      instructions&rdquo; are sometimes used interchangeably with WBT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here training on typing, and other software like Word, Excel, and
      PowerPoint could be learnt from the web through a well packaged
      tutorials. E.g. <em>www.learthat.com</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Computer Aided/Assisted Instructions (CAI)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a teaching process in which the computer is used to improve teaching
      and learning process. CAI software teaches specific skills and knowledge
      based on specific content area and level. It comes in a form of;
      presentation, demonstration, tutorial, drill and practice, simulation,
      games, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Drill and practice</strong>; assumes previous skills and that
      further practice are necessary for mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Educational Simulation software</strong>; provide an
      approximation of reality etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tutorial activity</strong>; include drill and practice, games and
      simulation. Tutorial program will provide an opportunity to enhance
      previous learning or create new learning based on curriculum objective.
      Good Tutorial offers help scenes to give further explanation or further
      illustration. It will also be able to interpret the amount of information
      to present and how to present it. When we evaluate Tutorials, we nee to
      evaluate if the Tutorial is not only able to present information, but
      must be able to interpret wrong answers. When it interprets wrong answers
      it should have the ability to continue the lesson form that point by
      providing feedback on the misunderstood information before continuing
      with new information. For class discussion on excel, the learner could
      use excel tutorial as a reinforcement of whatever was discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Electronic Books (e-book)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Electronic Book is the electronic counterpart of a printed book, which
      can be viewed on a desktop, or laptop computer or DPA. Numerous e-books
      can be kept on the same laptop, computer or handheld, that users take on
      the road eliminating weight and volume compared to the equivalent paper
      books. Electronic bookmarks made referencing easier, and most readers
      allow the user to annotate pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technical books are especially suited for e-books delivery because they
      can be searched. In addition, programming code examples can be quickly
      copied, which is why CD – ROMs that contain the entire text of the work
      have been included in the back of many technical paper books.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information Kiosk</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Information kiosk is a computer based terminal or display that is used to
      provide information or services, typically in a public places such as
      museums, airports hotels etc. kiosk systems are being used in a variety
      of applications, including information directories, customer self-service
      terminals electronic catalogs, internet access terminal, tourism guides
      and more. Some sophisticated kiosks let user interact and include touch
      screens, sound and motion video. A number of companies specialise in
      creating multimedia kiosks. A simple kiosk can be created using
      <em>HTML</em> pages and graphics, setting the type size large enough to
      attract people from a short distance and removing the web browser&rsquo;s tool
      bar so that the display screen is effectively in &ldquo;kiosk mode&rdquo;, t he
      presentation can be designed to simply loop through a series of pages or
      to allow user interaction ad exploration.

      <strong>Education Software for Basic Schools</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Children&rsquo;s learning and home learning</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense number of titles, probably running into the 1000&rsquo;s were
      developed and released from t he mid-1990&rsquo;s onwards, aimed primarily at
      the home education of younger children. Later iterations of these titles
      often began to link educational content to school curricula (such as
      <em>England&rsquo;s National Curriculum</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The design of educational software programs for home use has been
      influenced strongly by <em>computer gaming</em> concepts – in other
      words, <strong>they are designed to be fun as well as
      educational</strong>. However as far as possible a distinction should be
      drawn between proper learning titles (such as these) and software where
      the gaming outweighs the educational value (described later). Parents
      need such a distinction in order to make informed purchasing choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are examples of children&rsquo;s learning software which have a
      structured pedagogical approach, usually <strong>orientated</strong>
      <strong>towards</strong> <strong>literacy</strong> and
      <strong>numeracy</strong> <strong>skills</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Knowledge Adventure&rsquo;s</em> <em>Jumpstars</em> and <em>Maths
          Blaster</em> series
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>The Learning Company&rsquo;s</em> Reader Rabbit and <em>Zoombinis</em>
          series
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Disney Interactive</em> learning titles based on characters such
          as <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>The Jungle
          Book</em> and <em>Mickey Mouse</em>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Titles targeted at older children tend to focus more narrowly on
          reference (see below) or examination training.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Classroom Aids</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A further category of educational software is <strong>software designed
      for use in school classrooms</strong>. Typically such software may be
      projected onto a large whiteboard at the front of the class and/or run
      simultaneously on a network of desktop computers in a classroom. This
      type of software is often called <strong>classroom management
      software</strong> While teachers often choose to use educational software
      from other categories in their IT suites (e.g. reference works,
      children&rsquo;s software), a whole category of educational software has grown
      up specifically intended to assist classroom teaching. Branding has been
      less strong in this category than in those categories orientated towards
      home users. Software titles are often very specialised and produced by a
      wide variety of manufacturers, including many established educational
      book publishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The schoolzone.co.uk Guide to Digital Resources, 5<sup>th</sup> ed.
      (2005)</em> – An up-to-date full-colour guide with reviews of around 500
      selected and recommended products, categorised by subject area, albeit
      specific to the UK school system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Edutainment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a broader sense, the term <em>edutainment</em> describes an
      intentional merger of <em>computer games</em> and educational software
      into a single product (and could therefore also comprise more serious
      titles described above under children&rsquo;s learning software). In the narrow
      sense used here, the term describes educational software which is
      primarily about entertainment but tends to educate as well and sells
      itself partly under the educational umbrella. Software of this kind is
      not structured towards school curricula, does not normally involve
      educational advisors and does not focus on core skills such as literacy
      and numeracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Microsoft&rsquo;s Zoo Tycoon series, where children can learn about animals
          (and business skills) while simulating the management of a zoo.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Economic simulations such as <em>Capitalism</em> and Industry Giant,
          intended for older learners.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Encarta kids, where children learn new things as they play.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Features / Characteristics of Multimedia</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that characterise multimedia application is its
      interactive nature.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Interactivity/user participation:</strong> This allows users
          to choose the information to view, to control the pace and free flow
          of information and respond to items and receive feedback.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Links:</strong> This provides connections to related
          information. An interaction multimedia presentation is typically
          organized as a series of vacated pages. Each page present information
          and provides links or connections to related information. these
          information can be found; video, audio, text or graphics, which is
          accessed through the links provided.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Buttons:</strong> this enables users to navigate through a
          multimedia application and accessed information. By clicking on a
          special area called button you can make appropriate links and
          navigate through a presentation to locate and discover information.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Uses and Importance of Multimedia in the Classroom</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          When multimedia is used for lesson presentation, it makes teaching
          and learning much child centred. This motivates students to learn and
          also reduce the boredom in the classroom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Both learners and teachers are able to do effective and sequential
          lesson presentation when using multimedia like PowerPoint in teaching
          and learning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It allows lesson variation in terms of teaching methods and skills
          and also TLM. You can choose to use video, audio or text as your TLM
          when teaching.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It provides much room for research and learning for both teachers and
          students.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The interactive nature of multimedia motivates students to learn on
          their own.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It permits students to learn at their own pace and time thereby
          catering for individual difference which is a little bit difficult to
          achieve in the presence of an instructor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Learners have the opportunity to choose the topic they desire to
          learn and can decide whether to take a test at a particular time or
          not.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Importance of Multimedia Application</strong>
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Multimedia application serves as a means of advertising.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multimedia foster smooth dispatch of information through diverse
          means such as an online service delivers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          multimedia applications also helps in training (education) because of
          its visual effects on learning thereby encouraging cooperative
          learning and problem solving skills among students as well as
          research.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multimedia applications are a source of entertainment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For industrial purposes, multimedia applications are most useful in
          the art, presentations and graphics industries.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A multimedia program is designed to support the learning process.
          Multimedia offers the experience of listening, looking and doing in a
          computer-mediated setting. It can be interesting; motivating,
          exciting and help students achieve understanding in new ways.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The use of sound, photographs and video enables the user to observe
          real world situations which us just not possible with the more
          conventional methods of instruction. There is also a high level of
          interaction. Most packages expect students to make choices about what
          they want to do next and the way in which they wish to work through
          the materials. They are not passive but expect learners to actively
          participate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Education courses, skills and knowledge are too often taught out of
          context. To overcome this, educators are using multimedia to bring
          into their classrooms real-world examples to provide a contextual
          framework important for learning. Multimedia and tools like the
          Internet give faculty instant access to millions of resources. These
          materials can be called up instantly for cooperative learning,
          critical thinking, discussions, problem solving and self-study.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Multimedia will help spread the information age to millions of
          teachers/learners who have not yet used the computer. Multimedia
          educational computing is one of the fastest growing markets in t he
          world today.

      <li>
        <p>
          Commercial and educational available generic course wares to support
          commercial products are emerging. For these reasons, it is important
          to share information about what goes into the development of
          multimedia, and the appropriate use of multimedia, so that educators
          can make wise choices in selecting instructional applications.

      <strong>What is Technology?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It involves the method, theory and practices governing the application of
      practical mechanical sciences, to appropriate field such as education. It
      is the scientific way of attending to problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again it can also be said that technology is the term for the processes
      by which human beings fashion tools and machines to increase their
      control and understanding of the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What then is Educational Technology?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the application of technological knowledge and skills in education.
      Such applications have brought about drastic innovations in the method
      and effectiveness of teaching. Some of these innovations include
      filmstrips, slides, projections – and other mechanical and electronic
      devices to present systematic instructions to students. Others may
      include programmed instructions – delivered to students in a graded
      sequence of steps mostly by means of the computer or other device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear learner let us discuss the terms Curriculum and Integration briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Curriculum</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is concerned with the area of learning experiences to be organised by
      teacher; both within and outside the school, to enable pupils to adapt a
      positive attitude to learning to acquire and apply knowledge and skills,
      and to develop their tastes and a balanced sense of values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Integration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It simply means the incorporation of different entities into a unified
      body or system providing equality of opportunity with regards to the
      various components.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Integrating technology into the curriculum</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanation: it is the application of tools and equipment embodied in
      technology for the achievement of educational goals and objectives
      embodied in the curriculum.

    <p>
      Dear learner, even though you were set some tasks and you answered some
      questions at the end of each lesson and unit, we still wish to end the
      whole course with some questions that cut across all the units.
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions would serve as revision of the entire course for you, but
      more particularly they are intended to prepare you adequately for the
      end-of-semester examination, therefore learner, go through the questions
      on your own. We wish you the best of luck.
