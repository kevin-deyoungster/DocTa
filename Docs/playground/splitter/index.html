    ELEMENTS OF LANGUAGE~

  </h1>
  <h2>
   1.0 What is Language? @
  </h2>
  <p>
   The very first thing you notice about the heading is the use of the word
      “language” in the singular without the definite article. This is
      therefore different from “What is a language?”
  </p>
  <p>
   We are concerned with the study of language in general and our interest
      is in
   <strong>
    Natural Language
   </strong>
   (human).
  </p>
  <p>
   <img max-width="100%" src="image003.jpeg"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Some Definitions of Language
   </strong>
   :
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Language is a purely arbitrary human and non-linguistic method of
          communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of voluntarily
          produced symbols. (Edward Sapir)
    </p>
    <p>
     This definition suffers from several defects:
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     There is much that is communicated by language which is not covered
          by the words: ideas, emotions and desires.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     There are also other forms of expressing emotions other than the use
          of language.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The definition does not mention the spoken aspect of language which
          is important.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   However, Sapir makes good points in his definition.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     He mentions the fact that language is arbitrary and voluntary and is
          also stimulus free. (non-instinctive)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a
          social group cooperates. (Bloch, B. &amp; Trager, B. L.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The striking feature about this definition which contrasts the first
          definition is that it makes no appeal except indirectly and by
          implication the communicative function of language. (Obvious absence
          of the word communicate.) Instead it puts all the emphasis upon its
          social function and in so doing takes a rather narrow view of the
          role that language plays in society.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, this definition does not differ from Sapir’s in that it brings
          in the property of arbitrariness but explicitly restricts language to
          spoken language. (vocal symbols)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Language is the institution whereby humans communicate and interact
          with each other by means of habitually used oral-auditory arbitrary
          symbols. (Hall, R.A.)
    </p>
    <p>
     In Hall’s definition, we observe that both communication and
          interaction are introduced. Again, “oral-auditory” can be taken to be
          roughly equivalent to “vocal”, differing from it only in the
          “oral-auditory” which makes reference to the hearer as well as to the
          speaker. The property of arbitrariness is once again mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note that Hall employs the term “habitually used” – a term with
          historical origin. It takes its roots from the stimulus-response
          theories of the behaviourists and within the theoretical framework of
          behaviourism, the term “habit” acquired a rather special sense of
          appreciation.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Language is a symbol system … almost wholly based on pure or
          arbitrary convention. Languages are flexible and adaptable. (Robins,
          R. H.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Robins makes mention of the arbitrariness of language, he also states
          that language is flexible and adaptable. This shows that it is
          elastic and can be used in meaning several things. Human language has
          a way of accommodating for a change when the need arises.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “From now on I will consider a language to be a set (finite or
          infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of
          a finite set of elements.” (Noam Chomsky)
    </p>
    <p>
     Chomsky introduces the issue of language being infinite in his
          definition. By this, he means that any time language is used one is
          performing or producing it, you can produce only a set of sentences
          which can be finite. At the same time we can produce a lot of
          sentences with the same pattern (infinite). (Language is a limited
          (finite) set of symbols but can be combined to produce infinite
          sentences.)
    </p>
    <p>
     According to Chomsky, every person has a mechanism in his brain which
          processes language (speech). The mechanism is free of specificity to
          any language. It can process any language.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chomsky’s definition says nothing about the communicative function of
          either natural or non-natural language. It also says nothing about
          the symbolic nature of the elements or sequences of them. Its purpose
          is to focus attention on purely structural properties of language and
          to suggest that these properties can be investigated from a
          mathematically precise point of view.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Summary
   </strong>
   :
  </p>
  <p>
   Language is:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     A system of symbols used for communication.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Flexible and modifiable – can be used in meaning several things – it
          is not rigid. New examples can be added.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Arbitrary – there is no connection between what words stand for and
          the words themselves.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Free from stimulus control – non-instinctive and voluntary.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Structure dependent – organisation of symbols.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   1.1 What are the Constituents of Language? @
  </h2>
  <p>
   In
   <a>
    English
      grammar
   </a>
   , a constituency is a relation between a linguistic unit
      (i.e., a
   <em>
    constituent
   </em>
   ) and the larger unit that it is a part of.
      The constituency is traditionally represented by bracketing or tree
      structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   A constituent can be a
   <a>
    morpheme
   </a>
   ,
   <a>
    word
   </a>
   ,
   <a>
    phrase
   </a>
   , or
   <a>
    clause
   </a>
   .
      For instance, all the words and phrases that make up a clause are said to
      be constituents of that clause.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this Unit we shall look at the following constituencies in
      hierarchical order from bottom to the top:
  </p>

   Morpheme
  </p>
  <h2>
   1.2 Morpheme @
  </h2>
  <p>
   In English grammar and morphology, a
   <em>
    morpheme
   </em>
   is a meaningful
      linguistic unit consisting of a word (such as dog) or a word element
      (such as the -s at the end of dogs) that cannot be divided into smaller
      meaningful parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example: 1. unladylike (3 morphemes)
  </p>
  <p>
   un – not
  </p>
  <p>
   lady – (well-behaved) female adult (human)
  </p>
  <p>
   like – having the characteristics of
  </p>
  <p>
   (None can be broken up any more)
  </p>
  <p>
   2. dogs – (2 morphemes)
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘dog’
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘s’ – plural morpheme
  </p>
  <p>
   3. technique – (1 morpheme)
  </p>
  <p>
   2 syllables but 1 morpheme.
  </p>
  <h2>
   1.3 Types of Morphemes @
  </h2>
  <p>
   In linguistics, we would further classify morphemes as either as
   <strong>
    phonemes
   </strong>
   (the smallest units of grammar recognizable by
      sound) or
   <strong>
    graphemes
   </strong>
   (the smallest units of written
      language). For our purposes, we will focus on graphemes.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are two types of morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes. A
      "base" or "root" is a morpheme in a word that gives the word its
      principle meaning. An "affix" is a bound morpheme that occurs before or
      after a base. An affix that comes after a base is called a "suffix."
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    a)
   </strong>
   <strong>
    Free Morphemes
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   These are morphemes that can occur on their own without any morphemes
      necessarily attached to them. As such,
   <strong>
    free morphemes
   </strong>
   can stand by themselves as single, thoroughly independent words.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i.
   <em>
    manage
   </em>
   as in management
  </p>
  <p>
   ii.
   <em>
    mother
   </em>
   as in motherhood
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. or words such as
   <em>
    pen
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    tea
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    man
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Free morphemes can further be subcategorized into
   <a>
    content words
   </a>
   and
   <a>
    function words
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples of free morphemes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      the
     </em>
     (article)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      bird
     </em>
     (noun)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      like
     </em>
     (adjective)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      man
     </em>
     (noun)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      hard
     </em>
     (adjective)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      touch
     </em>
     (verb)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      his
     </em>
     (determiner)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      food
     </em>
     (noun)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      at
     </em>
     (preposition)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      dinner
     </em>
     (noun)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <strong>
    b)
   </strong>
   <strong>
    Bound Morphemes
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Bound morphemes in obvious contrast, only appear in combination with
      others, in most cases free morphemes. That is, these morphemes are bound
      in the very sense that they cannot stand alone and are thus necessarily
      attached to another form.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. “
   <em>
    -ment
   </em>
   ” as in management
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. "
   <em>
    un
   </em>
   " as in unhappy“''
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    c) Derivational Morphemes
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Derivational morphemes can be either a suffix or a prefix, and they have
      the ability to transform either the function or the meaning of a word.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    meaning
   </em>
   (noun) – meaning
   <em>
    less
   </em>
   (adjective)
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    beauty
   </em>
   (noun) – beauti
   <em>
    ful
   </em>
   (adjective)
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    quick
   </em>
   (adjective) – quick
   <em>
    ly
   </em>
   (adverb)
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    d)
   </strong>
   <strong>
    Inflectional Morphemes
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   An inflectional morpheme is a suffix that is added to a word to assign a
      particular grammatical property to that word. In English
   <a>
    morphology
   </a>
   ,
      an
   <em>
    inflectional morpheme
   </em>
   is a
   <a>
    suffix
   </a>
   that is
      added to a
   <a>
    word
   </a>
   to
      assign a particular
   <a>
    grammatical
   </a>
   property to that word.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inflectional morphemes serve as
   <a>
    grammatical
      markers
   </a>
   that indicate
   <a>
    tense
   </a>
   ,
   <a>
    number
   </a>
   ,
   <a>
    possession
   </a>
   ,
      or
   <a>
    comparison
   </a>
   .
      Inflectional morphemes in English include
      the
   <strong>
   </strong>
   <a>
    bound
      morphemes
   </a>
   <em>
    -s
   </em>
   (or
   <em>
    -es
   </em>
   );
   <em>
    's
   </em>
   (or
   <em>
    s'
   </em>
   );
   <em>
    -ed
   </em>
   ;
   <em>
    -en
   </em>
   ;
   <em>
    -er

   1.4 Word @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Some definitions of word:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. “A unit of expression which has universal intuitive recognition by
      native speaker, in
  </p>
  <p>
   both spoken and written language” (Crystal)
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. “A minimal free form” (Bloomfield)
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. “The smallest of linguistic unit which can occur on its own in
      speech or writing”
  </p>
  <p>
   (Richard &amp; Schmidt)
  </p>
  <p>
   iv. “A unit of meaning” (Finch)
  </p>
  <p>
   A word is the smallest free form in a language. A word may consist of
      only one morpheme but a single morpheme may not be a word. A word may
      include a root or stem. It may also include one or more affixes. Words
      can be combined to create other units of language.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eg: phrases, clauses, sentences.

  <h2>
   1.5 Some Types of Word Formation @
  </h2>
  <p>
   In linguistics, word formation is the creation of a new word. Word
      formation is sometimes contrasted with semantic change, which is a change
      in the meaning of the word.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Compounding
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Compounding forms a word out of two
          or more root morphemes. The words are called compounds or compound
          words. In Linguistics, compounds can be either native or borrowed.
          Native English roots are typically free morphemes, so that means
          native compounds are made out of independent words that can occur by
          themselves. Examples:
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      mailman
     </em>
     (composed of free root
     <em>
      mail
     </em>
     and free root
     <em>
      man
     </em>
     )
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      mail carrier
     </em>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      fireplace
     </em>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Some compounds have more than two component words. These are formed by
      successively combining words into compounds, e.g.
   <em>
    <strong>
     pick-up
      truck
    </strong>
   </em>
   , formed from
   <strong>
    <em>
     pick-up
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     truck
    </em>
   </strong>
   , where the first component,
   <em>
    <strong>
     pick-up
    </strong>
   </em>
   is itself a compound formed from
   <em>
    pick
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    up.
   </em>

     <strong>
      Derivation
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Derivation is the creation of words by modification of a root without
          the addition of other roots. Often the effect is a change in part of
          speech.

     <strong>
      (Sub-type of
          Derivation)
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The most common type of derivation is the addition of one or more
          affixes to a root, as in the word
     <em>
      derivation
     </em>
     itself. This
          process is called affixation, a term which covers both pre-fixation
          and suffixation.

      Blending
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Blending is one of the most beloved of word formation processes in
          English. It is especially creative in that speakers take two words
          and merge them based not on morpheme structure but on sound
          structure. The resulting words are called blends.

      Clipping
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Clipping is a type of abbreviation of a word in which one part is
          'clipped' off the rest, and the remaining word now means essentially
          the same thing as what the whole word means or meant.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example:
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>
      rifle
     </em>
     is a fairly modern clipping of an earlier compound
     <em>

     ,
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <em>

      Acronyms
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Acronyms are formed by taking the initial letters of a phrase and
          making a word out of it. Acronyms provide a way of turning a phrase
          into a word. The classical acronym is also pronounced as a word.

  <h2>
   1.6 Phrase @
  </h2>
  <p>
   In grammar a phrase is a group of various words functioning as a single
      unit in the syntax of a sentence. A phrase can be simple (one word) or
      complex (a group of words)
  </p>
  <p>
   Eg: the store at the end of the street….. (a noun phrase)
  </p>
  <p>
   Most phrases have a central word defining the type of phrase. This word
      is called the head of the phrase. Phrases may be classified by the type
      of head:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Prepositional phrase (PP): A prepositional phrase begins with a
          preposition and can act as a noun, an adjective or an adverb.
     <br/>
     The book was
     <em>
      on the table.
     </em>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Noun phrase (NP) – A noun phrase consists of a noun and all its
          modifiers.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <em>
    The bewildered tourist
   </em>
   was lost.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Verb phrase (VP) – A verb phrase consists of a verb and all its
          modifiers.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   He
   <em>
    was waiting for the rain to stop.

  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Appositive phrase (AP) – An appositive phrase restates a noun and
          consists of one or more words usually introduced by commas.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Bob,
   <em>

     Gerund Phrases: A gerund phrase is simply a noun phrase that starts
          with a gerund.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <em>
    Taking
   </em>

  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Infinitive Phrases: An infinitive phrase is a noun phrase that begins
          with an infinitive.
    </p>

     </em>
     , I wish I had never come here.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Absolute Phrases: An absolute phrase has a subject, but not an acting
          verb, so it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It modifies
          the whole sentence, not just a noun.
    </p>

  <h2>
   1.7 Clause @
  </h2>
  <p>
   A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate
      but cannot always be considered as a full grammatical sentence. Clauses
      can be either independent clauses (also called main clauses) or dependent
      clauses (also called subordinate clauses)
  </p>
  <p>
   Clause contrasts with sentence. Except in the case of a whole sentence,
      which is technically said to be also a clause, a clause is always smaller
      than the sentence that contains it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Clause also contrasts with
   <a>
    phrase
   </a>
   . Clauses
      contain phrases. Clauses are bigger than the simple phrases they contain.
      The crucial characteristic of a clause, which is lacking from a phrase,
      is that a clause normally has its own verb and all or many of the other
      basic ingredients of a whole sentence.
  </p>

  <h2>
   1.8 Sentences @
  </h2>
  <p>
   A sentence is a group of words that are put together to mean something. A
      sentence is the basic unit of language which expresses a complete
      thought. A complete sentence has at least a subject and a main verb to
      state (declare) a complete thought.
  </p>
  <p>
   The five main parts of a sentence are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>

  <h3>
   1.8.1 Types of Sentences
  </h3>
  <p>
   1.
   <strong>
    Simple Sentence
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A simple sentence has the most basic elements that make it a sentence: a
      subject, a verb, and a completed thought.
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples
  </p>
  <p>
   a. Joe waited for the train.
   <br/>
   "Joe" = subject, "waited" = verb
  </p>
  <p>
   b. The train was late.
   <br/>
   "The train" = subject, "was" = verb
  </p>
  <p>
   The use of compound subjects, compound verbs, prepositional phrases
      (such as "at the bus station"), and other elements help lengthen simple
      sentences, but simple sentences often are short.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    2. Compound Sentence
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A compound sentence refers to a sentence made up of two independent
      clauses (or complete sentences) connected to one another with a
      coordinating conjunction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples
  </p>
  <p>
   a. Joe waited for the train,
   <strong>
    but
   </strong>
   the train was
        late.
   <br/>
   b. Mary and Samantha left on the bus before I arrived,
   <strong>
    so
   </strong>
   I did not see them at the bus
  </p>
  <p>
   station.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    3. Complex sentence
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and one or more
      dependent clauses connected to it. A dependent clause is similar to an
      independent clause, or complete sentence, but it lacks one of the
      elements that would make it a complete sentence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples
  </p>
  <p>
   a.
   <em>
    When he came
   </em>
   I had left.
  </p>
  <p>
   b. I could not go to the stadium
   <em>
    because it was raining
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    4. Compound Complex
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A compound-complex sentence is comprised of at least two independent
      clauses and one or more dependent clauses
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples
  </p>
  <p>
   a. Although I like to go camping, I haven't had the time to go lately,
        and I haven't found anyone to go with.
  </p>
  <p>
   (independent clause: "I haven't had the time to go lately")
  </p>
  <p>
   (independent clause: "I haven't found anyone to go with")
  </p>
  <p>
   (dependent clause: "Although I like to go camping... ")
  </p>
  <p>
   b. We decided that the movie was too violent, but our children, who
        like to watch scary movies, thought that we were wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
   (independent clause: "We decided that the movie was too violent")
  </p>
  <p>
   (independent clause: "(but) our children thought that we were wrong")
  </p>
  <p>
   (dependent clause: who like to watch scary movies)
  </p>
  <p>
   (Note: Compound-complex sentences are very common in English, but one
      mistake that students often make is to try to write them without having
      mastered the
   <a>
    simple sentences
   </a>
   ,
   <a>
    compound sentences
   </a>
   , and
   <a>
    complex sentences
   </a>
   first.)

  <h2>
   1.9 Paragraph @
  </h2>
  <p>
   A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is
      usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of many
      sentences. It is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing
      with a particular point or idea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by
      missing a line out, and then starting again; this makes telling when one
      paragraph ends and another begins easier.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paragraphs contain a topic sentence. This topic sentence of the paragraph
      tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.
  </p>
  <p>
   A basic paragraph structure usually consists of these elements: the topic
      sentence, three supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence
  </p>

   <strong>
    SUBJECT VERB AGREEMENT - (CONCORD)~
   </strong>
  </h1>
  <h2>
   2.1 Introduction @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Just as special events can “fit” with certain celebrations, subjects and
      verbs must “fit” together in sentences. For example, you never say,
      *“
   <em>
    I are the winner
   </em>
   ” or *“
   <em>
    Is they your best friends?”
   </em>
   You will hear that something is wrong with these sentences. The problem
      is that the subjects and verbs do not agree.
  </p>
  <p>
   In most of the sentences we speak and write, the subjects and the verbs
      agree automatically. You would probably say, “
   <em>
    I am the winner
   </em>
   ”
      or “
   <em>
    Are they your best friends
   </em>
   ?” This Unit will explain the
      rules of agreement and how to make parts of sentences work together
      correctly.

   It is important to establish the relationship between the subject and the
      verb. The number of a word can be singular or plural. Plural words
      indicate
   <em>
    more than one
   </em>
   .
   <em>
    Only nouns, pronouns and verbs
   </em>
   can indicate number.

  <h2>
   2.2 Recognizing the Number of Nouns and Pronouns @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Most of the time, it is easy to tell whether a noun or pronoun is
      singular or plural. Compare, for example, the singular and plural forms
      of the nouns in the following chart:
  </p>
  <table border="1">
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>
      <strong>
       NOUNS
      </strong>
     </th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <strong>
       Singular
      </strong>
     </td>
     <td>
      <strong>
       Plural
      </strong>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      custom
     </td>
     <td>
      customs
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      box
     </td>
     <td>
      boxes
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      knife
     </td>
     <td>
      knives
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      mouse
     </td>
     <td>
      mice
     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
   Most nouns are made plural by adding “s” or “es” to the singular form
      (customs and boxes). Some nouns become plurals in other ways (knives and
      mice). Pronouns have different forms to indicate singular and plural. For
      example,
   <em>
    I, he, she, it and this
   </em>
   are singular.
   <em>
    We, they, and
      these
   </em>
   are plural.
   <em>
    You, who and some
   </em>
   are either singular or
      plural.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2.3 Recognizing the Number of Verbs @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Like nouns, verbs can indicate singular and plural forms. Problems
      involving the number in verbs normally involve the third-person forms of
      the present tense (she wants, they want) and certain forms of the verb be
      (I am; he is or was; we are or were).
  </p>

  <p>
   To check for agreement between a subject and verb, begin by determining
      the number of the subject. Then, make sure it agrees with the verb.
  </p>
  <p>
   This means that if the subject is singular (one) the verb should agree
      with the noun:
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     The teacher
     <strong>
      is
     </strong>
     in the classroom.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     John
     <strong>
      eats
     </strong>
     apples every day.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The president
     <strong>
      is
     </strong>
     accountable to the electorate.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Plural nouns (more than one) have to agree with the form of the verbs.
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     Cars
     <strong>
      are
     </strong>
     important in the society.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Non-residential students
     <strong>
      have
     </strong>
     halls of affiliation.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Many women
     <strong>
      like

     sweets.

   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
   2.4 Modifications @
  </h2>
  <p>
   a) When the singular subjects are defined by the words
   <em>
    each, every,
      anyone
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    everybody, nobody, somebody, no one
   </em>
   , the singular
      verb is used.
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     Each student in the university
     <strong>
      studies
     </strong>

    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Nobody
     <strong>
      has
     </strong>
     the mandate to nominate a new leader for
          the class.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Everybody
     <strong>
      is
     </strong>
     supposed to register fro the elections.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   b) The singular verb is used when two singular verbs are connected with
      “and” refer
  </p>
  <p>
   to the same subject or idea.
  </p>
  <ol start="4" type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     Rice and stew
     <strong>
      is

    <p>
     Her husband and manager
     <strong>
      controls
     </strong>
     all her business
          dealings.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   c) A compound subject joined by
   <em>
    and
   </em>
   is usually plural and must
      have a plural verb.
  </p>
  <p>
   i. The
   <em>
    boy and the girl
   </em>
   <strong>
    are waiting
   </strong>
   for the

   <em>
    boys and girls
   </em>
   <strong>
    are waiting
   </strong>
   for the bus.
  </p>
  <p>
   d) In mathematical computations and in the case of
   <em>
    any
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    none
   </em>
   , both the
  </p>
  <p>
   singular and plural are used.
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     Six plus four

     </strong>
     likely to pass the examination
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Although both forms are grammatically correct, the singular is used
          in formal style for
     <em>
      none
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      any.
     </em>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   e) In the case of collective nouns like
   <em>
    staff, band, crowd, audience,
      family, etc
   </em>
   ,
  </p>
  <p>
   either the singular or the plural form can be used depending on whether
        the noun is considered as one group or the members are considered
        individually.
  </p>
  <p>
   f) When two or more singular verbs are connected with
   <em>
    but, neither,
      nor, either
   </em>
   ,
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    or,
   </em>
   a singular form of the verb is required.
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     Neither the boy nor the girl
     <strong>
      is
     </strong>
     guilty of the
          offence.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Not only his brother, but his friend
     <strong>
      finds
     </strong>
     him odd.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     When one of the nouns connected by
     <em>
      or, but, nor
     </em>
     is singular
          and the other is plural, the noun closer to the verb agrees with it.
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
     <li>
      <p>
       Either the boy or the girls are to blame for the offence.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Either the boys or the girl is to blame for the offence.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   g) When a singular subject is followed immediately by such group of words
      like
   <em>
    as well as, in addition to, including, no less than, with,
      together with,
   </em>
   or any similar construction, the singular verb is
      required no matter the status of the subject that comes after these
      words.
  </p>
  <ol start="3" type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     Gbagbo as well as his wife

   <li>
    <p>
     The president together with his ministers
     <strong>
      is
     </strong>
     visiting the Ashanti Region.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   If the sentences look awkward, then re-write it.
  </p>
  <p>
   a) The president together with his ministers is visiting the Ashanti
      Region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sentence can be re-written as:
  </p>
  <p>
   b) Both the president and his ministers are visiting the Ashanti Region.
  </p>
  <p>
   h) When a subject is followed by a plural modifier, a singular verb is
      required.
  </p>
  <p>
   i. One of my children
   <strong>
    has
   </strong>
   a very good appetite.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. The syllabus which contains all the topics to be studied
   <strong>
    is
   </strong>
   helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
   i) Where the subject is a relative pronoun, the verb must agree with the
      antecedent of the pronoun.
  </p>
  <p>
   i. She is one of the girls
   <strong>
    who
   </strong>
   sing in the church.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. His child is one of the
   <strong>
    students
   </strong>
   who play tennis.
  </p>
  <p>
   j) When a plural noun is use to indicate a sum or unit, a singular verb
      is used.
  </p>
  <p>
   i. Fifty years
   <strong>
    passes
   </strong>
   so soon in the life of a man.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. Two hundred Ghana cedis
   <strong>
    is
   </strong>
   a lot of money.
  </p>
  <p>
   k) Some words are in the plural form but are usually singular in meaning,
      such
  </p>
  <p>
   words take singular verbs.

  </p>
  <p>
   Coordination can show addition, contrast, choice/alternative and result.
  </p>
  <p>
   i.
   <strong>
    Addition
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The statements are of equal rank but what follows the connective is
        supplementary to
  </p>
  <p>
   what precedes it.
  </p>
  <p>
   a) I love him
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
   he loves me.
  </p>
  <p>
   b) John went to the bank
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
   withdrew some money.
  </p>
  <p>
   The conjunctions which indicate addition are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     and
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     also

    <p>

    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   ii.
   <strong>
    Contrast
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The clauses are of equal rank but the clause that follows the
        conjunction is in contrast to what precedes it.
  </p>
  <p>
   a) He wanted to buy a new shirt
   <strong>
    but
   </strong>
   his money was not
        enough.
  </p>
  <p>
   b) The trip was expensive
   <strong>
    but
   </strong>
   it was worth it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The conjunctions which indicate contrast are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     but
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     however
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     nevertheless
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     still
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     yet (there is usually a comma after “yet”)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   “Yet” is used mainly in written English to join clauses where, there is a
      contrast that is of a surprising nature.
  </p>
  <p>
   a) He is a quiet man
   <strong>
    yet
   </strong>
   , he manages to command
        attention.
  </p>
  <p>
   b) John was suffering from a hamstring injury
   <strong>
    yet
   </strong>
   , he
        managed to play full time.
  </p>
  <p>
   iii.
   <strong>
    Choice or Alternative (Correlative Conjunctions)
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   They get their name from the fact that they work together (co-) and
      relate one sentence element to another. They are also known as a paired
      coordinator and a conjunctive pair.
  </p>
  <p>
   Correlative conjunctions suggest an alternative possibility and include
      pairs like:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     both……..and
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     whether…….or
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     either………or
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     neither…….nor
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     not………..but
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     not only……..but also
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   a)
   <strong>
    Either
   </strong>
   we travel by air
   <strong>
    or

   <strong>
    Position of Coordinators
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   In clausal coordination, the coordinators: “and”, “or”, and “but” are
      restricted to the initial position in the clause. They occur at the
      beginning of the second or final clause.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example,
  </p>
  <p>
   The man plays the violin,
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
   his wife plays the piano.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.2 Punctuation @
  </h2>
  <p>
   The conjunctions: “and”, “or”, “yet” and “but” are usually preceded by a
      comma, while the semicolon precedes conjunctions like “accordingly”,
      “consequently”, “nevertheless”, “likewise”, “however”, and “furthermore”.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.3 What is Faulty Coordination? @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Faulty coordination occurs when two coordinate clauses have unequal ideas
      and these two clauses are mistakenly treated as though they should be
      given equal emphasis. Faulty coordination is joining two clauses in such
      a way that the meaning is illogical
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   a) The iPhone is the best smart phone,
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
   I bought
        one.
  </p>
  <p>
   b) The bus driver is a careless person,
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
   he was
        pulled over by the police.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.4 Subordination @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Subordination is connecting two unequal but related clauses with a
      subordinating conjunction to form a complex sentence. When you
      subordinate one clause to another, you make the subordinate or dependent
      clause develop the main clause. The subordinate clause works to throw
      more light on the main clause.
  </p>
  <p>
   The main clause can stand on its own, but the subordinate or dependent
      clause amplifies the main clause, it has a subject and a verb but cannot
      stand on its own. A clause which begins with a subordinating conjunction
      is called a subordinating clause.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.5 What is a Clause? @
  </h2>
  <p>
   A clause is a group of words with its own subject and verb.
  </p>
  <p>
   Types of Clauses
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Finite Clause: A finite clause is a clause whose verb element is
          finite (such as
     <em>
      takes
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      took
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      can work
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      has worked
     </em>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     For example: I cannot go out with you because
     <u>
      I am studying this evening
     </u>
     .
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Non-Finite Clause: A non-finite clause is a clause whose verb element
          is non-finite
    </p>
    <p>
     (such as
     <em>
      to work, having worked
     </em>
     )
    </p>
    <p>
     For example:
     <u>
      Knowing my temper
     </u>
     , I did
          not reply.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Verbless Clause: A clause that does not have a verb element, but is
          nevertheless capable of being analysed as in clause elements.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example:
     <u>
      Although always helpful
     </u>
     ,
          he was not much liked.
    </p>
    <p>
     (
     <u>
      Although he was always helpful
     </u>
     , he
          was not much liked.)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   3.6 Types of Subordinate Clauses @
  </h2>
  <p>
   There are three main types of subordinate clauses:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Noun (nominal)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Relative/Adjective
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adverb
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   1.
   <strong>
    Noun Clause
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The noun clause performs the function of a noun in a sentence. It is
      usually introduced by
   <em>
    that, where, why, what, how
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    whatever.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i.
   <u>
    Where we went
   </u>
   should not bother you.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii.
   <u>
    Whatever he did
   </u>
   was wonderful.
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. This is
   <u>
    what he did
   </u>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   2.
   <strong>
    Relative Clause @
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The relative clause provides more information about nouns. It
      post-modifies the noun phrase. The noun which is modified is called the
      antecedent. The clause is introduced by a relative pronoun:
   <em>
    who,
      whose, that, which
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    whom
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. The people
   <u>
    who live upstairs
   </u>
   are having
      a party.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. The house
   <u>
    which I want to buy
   </u>
   has been
      sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. All the boys
   <u>
    who took part in the
      robbery
   </u>
   have been arrested by the police.
  </p>
  <h2>
   3.7 Defining and Non-Defining Relative Clauses @
  </h2>
  <p>
   The relative clause can be defining or non-defining.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Defining/Restrictive Relative Clause
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The relative clause is not separated by a comma. It acts as an
          adjective by providing more information about a particular noun.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For example: The girl
   <u>
    who was on the bus with
      us
   </u>
   is from Brazil.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Non-Defining/Non-Restrictive Clause
     </strong>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   This clause adds extra information to the whole or the main clause
        separated by commas.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. The man next door,
   <u>
    who works alone
   </u>
   , is
      dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. My brother, who lives in Canada, is a doctor. (he has only one
      brother)
  </p>
  <p>
   (My brother who lives in Canada is a doctor. Restrictive clause – he
        has many brothers).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    3. Adverb Clause
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   An adverb clause is a subordinate clause that modifies
   <em>
    a verb, an
      adjective or an adverb
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Adverb clauses can answer any of the questions about the words they
      modify:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Where?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Why?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     In what way? (manner)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Under what condition?
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     To what extent?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>

   <strong>
    REPORTING WHAT PEOPLE SAY~
   </strong>
  </h1>
  <p>
   <strong>
    (DIRECT AND INDIRECT SPEECH)
   </strong>
  </p>
  <h2>
   4.1 Introduction @
  </h2>
  <p>
   There are two ways of relating what a person has said: direct and
      indirect. In direct speech, we repeat the original speaker’s exact words.
  </p>
  <p>
   He said, “I have lost my wallet.”
  </p>
  <p>
   What is repeated is placed between inverted commas and a comma or a colon
      is placed immediately before the remark.
  </p>
  <p>
   You indicate that you are quoting or reporting what someone has said by
      using a
   <strong>
    reporting verb
   </strong>
   . Every reporting clause contains
      a
   <strong>
    reporting verb.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Some basic reporting verbs include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     “say” – when you are simply reporting what someone said and do not
          want to add any more information.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example: She said that she didn’t know about the story.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   4.2 Quote Structure (Direct Speech) @
  </h2>
  <p>
   When you want to say that a person used particular words, you use a quote
      structure (direct speech). A quote structure consists of two clauses.
  </p>
  <p>
   i. One clause is the
   <strong>
    reporting clause
   </strong>
   which contains the
      reporting verb.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. The second clause is the
   <strong>
    quote
   </strong>
   which represents what
      someone says.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   a)
   <strong>
    “I knew I’d seen you,”
   </strong>
   I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    ↓ ↓
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   (quote clause) (reporting clause)
  </p>
  <p>
   b) “Only one,”
   <strong>
    replied the doctor.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    ↓ ↓
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   (quote clause) (reporting clause)
  </p>
  <h2>
   4.3 Position of Reporting Verb @
  </h2>
  <p>
   There are several positions in which you can put the reporting clause in
      relation to a quote.
  </p>
  <p>
   The usual position is after a quote, but it can also be in front of the
      quote or in the middle of the quote.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   a) “You have to keep trying,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   b) “You see,” he said, “my father was a clergyman.”
  </p>
  <p>
   c) He said, “We have to go home.”
  </p>
  <h2>
   4.4 Punctuation of Quotes @
  </h2>
  <p>
   You can use either the single inverted commas (‘’) or double inverted
      commas (“ ”). The one used to begin the quote is called
   <strong>
    opening
   </strong>
   inverted commas, and the one used as the end is
      called
   <strong>
    closing
   </strong>
   inverted commas.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   a) “Let’s go,” I whispered.
  </p>
  <p>
   b) ‘Let’s go,’ I whispered.
  </p>
  <p>
   c) “What do you mean,” I demanded, “by a population problem?”
  </p>
  <h2>
   4.5 Report Structure (Indirect Speech) @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Reported or indirect speech is usually used to talk about the past, so we
      normally change the tense of the words spoken. We use reporting verbs
      like 'say', 'tell', 'ask', and we may use the word 'that' to introduce
      the reported words. Inverted commas are not used.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    She said, "I saw him." (direct speech) = She said that she had seen
      him. (indirect speech)
   </em>

   <strong>
    Say' and 'tell'
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Use 'say' when there is no indirect object:
   <br/>
   <em>
    He said that he was tired.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Always use 'tell' when you say who was being spoken to (i.e. with an
      indirect object):
   <br/>
   <em>
    He told me that he was tired.
   </em>

   <em>
    He talked to us.
    <br/>
    She was speaking on the telephone.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   A report structure has two parts. One part is the reporting clause, which
      contains the reporting verb.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   a)
   <u>
    I told him
   </u>
   that nothing
   <em>
    was going
      to happen to me
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   ↓ ↓
  </p>
  <p>
   (reporting clause) (reported clause)
  </p>
  <p>
   b)
   <u>
    I have agreed
   </u>
   that
   <em>
    we should do
      it
   </em>
   .

  </p>
  <p>
   (reporting clause) (reported clause)
  </p>
  <h2>
   4.6 Position of the Reporting Clause @
  </h2>
  <p>
   We usually put the reporting clause first in order to make it clear that
      you are reporting rather than speaking directly yourself. However, if you
      want to emphasize the statement contained in the reported clause, you can
      alter the order and put the reported clause first with a comma after it.
      (That is not used in this case.)
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   a)
   <u>
    All the things were trivial
   </u>
   ,
   <em>
    he
      said.

   4.7 Tense in Indirect Speech @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Indirect speech can be introduced by a verb in the present tense when:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     reporting a conversation that is still going on;
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     reading a letter and reporting what it says;
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     reading instructions and reporting;
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     reporting a statement that someone makes often;
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     talking about reports attributed to famous works or authors which
          have present validity.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Apart from these situations, indirect speech is usually introduced by a
      verb in the past tense.

   <strong>
    4.8 Rules for Changing Direct into Indirect Speech @
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Get one thing straight – you do not have to learn the rules by heart.
      Simply understand what they ask you to do and apply the same in
      converting a sentence from direct to indirect speech.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.8.1 Rule One: @
  </h3>
  <p>
   If in direct speech you find say/says or will say then
   <strong>
    do not
      change the tense
   </strong>
   that you can find within the quotation marks.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. a) I say, “I am elated.”
  </p>
  <p>
   b) I say I am elated
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. a) He says, “I was a fool then.”
  </p>
  <p>
   b) He says he was a fool then.
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. a) She says, “I will be more experienced then.”
  </p>
  <ol type="a">
   <li>
    <p>
     She says she will be more experienced then.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
   4.8.2 Rule Two @
  </h3>
  <p>
   If in direct speech the words within the quotation marks talk of a
      universal truth or habitual action then
   <strong>
    Rule One
   </strong>
   is
      followed or in other words the tense inside the quotation marks is not
      changed at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. The teacher said, “The sun rises in the east.”
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. The teacher said the sun rises in the east.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.8.3 Rule Three @
  </h3>
  <p>
   If there is 'said' in the direct speech then the tense of the words
      inside quotation marks is changed to the past tense.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. a) I said,” I am suffering from a fit of malaria”
  </p>
  <p>
   b) I said I was suffering from a fit of malaria.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. a) I said, “My mother cooks well”
  </p>
  <p>
   b) I said my mother cooked well.

   4.9 Reporting Questions (Indirect Questions) @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Indirect questions aren’t questions in the strict sense of the term. They
      do not have the word order of typical questions. They also don’t have a
      question mark at the end. Indirect questions are usually contained within
      a statement.
  </p>
  <p>
   The reporting verb most often used for reporting questions is “ask”.
  </p>
  <p>
   a) I asked if I could stay with them.
  </p>
  <p>
   b. He asked me where I was going.

   <strong>
    How to introduce an indirect question?
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   1. If the direct question begins with a question word like
   <strong>
    what,
      when, where, how
   </strong>
   etc., that word is used to introduce the
      indirect question.
  </p>
  <p>
   Study the following examples.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Where are you going?” she asked. (Direct question)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     She asked me
     <strong>
      where I was going
     </strong>
     . (Indirect question)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Here the indirect question
   <em>
    where I was going
   </em>
   is the direct
      object of the verb asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   2.
   <strong>
    Yes / no
   </strong>
   questions
  </p>
  <p>
   When reporting a yes/no question, we use
   <em>
    <strong>
     if
    </strong>
   </em>
   or
   <em>
    <strong>
     whether
    </strong>
   </em>
   :
  </p>
  <p>
   i. a) “Have you booked tickets for the concert?” Alex asked.
   <br/>
   b) Alex was wondering if/whether I had booked tickets for the concert.
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. a) “Is there a wireless network available in the library?” Peter
      inquired.
   <br/>
   b) Peter inquired if/whether there was a wireless network available in
      the library.
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. a) “Is it cold outside?” Kwame asked.
   <br/>
   b) Kwame wants to know if/whether it is cold outside or not.
  </p>
  <p>
   3. When reporting direct questions, we backshift tenses when the
      reporting verb is in the past tense. When the reporting verb is in the
      present tense, we do not usually backshift tenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Negative questions are usually reported as affirmative questions.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Aren’t you coming with me?” John asked. (Direct question)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     John asked me if I was going with him. (Indirect question)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   4.
   <strong>
    Shall
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Some people use
   <strong>
    shall
   </strong>
   instead of
   <strong>
    will
   </strong>
   when the subject is
   <strong>
    I
   </strong>
   or
   <strong>
    we.
   </strong>
   When
        these statements or questions are reported,
   <strong>
    shall
   </strong>
   will
        become
   <strong>
    should
   </strong>
   if the subject of the indirect speech is
   <strong>
    I
   </strong>
   or
   <strong>
    we.
   </strong>
   If the subject is a second
        or third person noun or pronoun,
   <strong>
    shall
   </strong>
   will become
   <strong>
    would.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     ‘I shall see you tomorrow’ said Andrew.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Andrew said that he would see me the next day.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   When we want to make a question more polite, we often introduce the
      sentence with expressions such as
   <em>
    Could you tell me...?, Do you
      know...?
   </em>
   etc. and continue with an indirect question:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Could you tell me how I can get to the railway station?
    </p>
   </li>

   5.1 Ambiguities @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Words, as we know, often have more than one meaning, and that is the
      classic instance of ambiguity. Ambiguity has another sense, however.
      Occasionally, phrases and clauses create ambiguity because their
      structures may be interpreted in more than one way, leading to different
      meanings for the sentence as a whole. Such ambiguity is called
      'grammatical ambiguity.'
  </p>
  <p>
   In
   <a>
    English grammar
   </a>
   ,
      syntactic ambiguity is the presence of two or more possible
   <a>
    meanings
   </a>
   within a single
   <a>
    sentence
   </a>
   or
      sequence of
   <a>
    words
   </a>
   , it
      is also called structural ambiguity or grammatical ambiguity.
      Compared with
   <a>
    lexical

      a single word).

   Lexical ambiguity is the presence of two or more possible meanings within
      a single word. It is also called semantic ambiguity or homonymy.

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     He went to the bank.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   ‘Bank’ in this sentence could refer to two things:
  </p>
  <ol type="i">
   <li>
    <p>
     bank – a place where money transactions are made.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>

   <em>
    captain
   </em>
   has one meaning: 'the person in command of

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     She greeted the teacher with a smile.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The source of the ambiguity is the prepositional phrase (with a smile) as
      it could refer to both the teacher and the girl herself.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The German history teacher will be teaching me next semester.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The source of the ambiguity here is the adjective (history teacher) which
      could be interpreted in two ways: the teacher is a German and teaches
      history. The other is that the teacher teaches German history.

   5.2 Dangling Modifiers @
  </h2>
  <p>
   Misplaced and Dangling Modifiers refer to phrases or clauses attributed
      or attached to wrong headwords (a noun or verb) which cannot be
      identified in the sentence. A modifier is a word or phrase that gives
      more information about the subject, verb or object in a clause. Because
      of the separation, sentences with this error often sound awkward,
      ridiculous, or confusing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    a. Walking towards the office
   </em>
   , the bull crossed the street.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    b. On his way home, Kwame found a gold man’
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Let us have a close look at the modifiers in the two sentences. In (a),
      the only noun in the sentence is “bull”. It therefore appears that the
      “bull” was walking to the office. This is not possible because a bull
      cannot work in an office. In sentence (b), suggests that a
   <strong>
    gold
      man
   </strong>
   owns a watch.
