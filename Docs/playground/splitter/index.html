    <h2>
        1.0 What is Language?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The very first thing you notice about the heading is the use of the word “language” in the singular without the definite
        article. This is therefore different from “What is a language?”
    </p>
    <p>
        We are concerned with the study of language in general and our interest is in
        <strong>
            Natural Language
        </strong>
        (human).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Some Definitions of Language
        </strong>
        :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Language is a purely arbitrary human and non-linguistic method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of voluntarily
                produced symbols. (Edward Sapir)
            </p>
            <p>
                This definition suffers from several defects:
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                There is much that is communicated by language which is not covered by the words: ideas, emotions and desires.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                There are also other forms of expressing emotions other than the use of language.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The definition does not mention the spoken aspect of language which is important.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, Sapir makes good points in his definition.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                He mentions the fact that language is arbitrary and voluntary and is also stimulus free. (non-instinctive)
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates. (Bloch, B. &amp; Trager, B.
                L.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The striking feature about this definition which contrasts the first definition is that it makes no appeal except indirectly
                and by implication the communicative function of language. (Obvious absence of the word communicate.) Instead
                it puts all the emphasis upon its social function and in so doing takes a rather narrow view of the role
                that language plays in society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, this definition does not differ from Sapir’s in that it brings in the property of arbitrariness but explicitly restricts
                language to spoken language. (vocal symbols)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Language is the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with each other by means of habitually used oral-auditory
                arbitrary symbols. (Hall, R.A.)
            </p>
            <p>
                In Hall’s definition, we observe that both communication and interaction are introduced. Again, “oral-auditory” can be taken
                to be roughly equivalent to “vocal”, differing from it only in the “oral-auditory” which makes reference
                to the hearer as well as to the speaker. The property of arbitrariness is once again mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that Hall employs the term “habitually used” – a term with historical origin. It takes its roots from the stimulus-response
                theories of the behaviourists and within the theoretical framework of behaviourism, the term “habit” acquired
                a rather special sense of appreciation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Language is a symbol system … almost wholly based on pure or arbitrary convention. Languages are flexible and adaptable.
                (Robins, R. H.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Robins makes mention of the arbitrariness of language, he also states that language is flexible and adaptable. This shows
                that it is elastic and can be used in meaning several things. Human language has a way of accommodating for
                a change when the need arises.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                “From now on I will consider a language to be a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed
                out of a finite set of elements.” (Noam Chomsky)
            </p>
            <p>
                Chomsky introduces the issue of language being infinite in his definition. By this, he means that any time language is used
                one is performing or producing it, you can produce only a set of sentences which can be finite. At the same
                time we can produce a lot of sentences with the same pattern (infinite). (Language is a limited (finite)
                set of symbols but can be combined to produce infinite sentences.)
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Chomsky, every person has a mechanism in his brain which processes language (speech). The mechanism is free
                of specificity to any language. It can process any language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chomsky’s definition says nothing about the communicative function of either natural or non-natural language. It also says
                nothing about the symbolic nature of the elements or sequences of them. Its purpose is to focus attention
                on purely structural properties of language and to suggest that these properties can be investigated from
                a mathematically precise point of view.

    <h2>
        1.1 What are the Constituents of Language?
    </h2>
    <p>
        In
        <a>
            English grammar
        </a>
        , a constituency is a relation between a linguistic unit (i.e., a
        <em>
            constituent
        </em>
        ) and the larger unit that it is a part of. The constituency is traditionally represented by bracketing or tree structures.
    </p>
    <p>
        A constituent can be a
        <a>
            morpheme
        </a>
        ,
        <a>
            word
        </a>
        ,
        <a>
            phrase
        </a>
        , or
        <a>
            clause
        </a>
        . For instance, all the words and phrases that make up a clause are said to be constituents of that clause.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this Unit we shall look at the following constituencies in hierarchical order from bottom to the top:

    <h2>
        1.2 Morpheme
    </h2>
    <p>
        In English grammar and morphology, a
        <em>
            morpheme
        </em>
        is a meaningful linguistic unit consisting of a word (such as dog) or a word element (such as the -s at the end of dogs)
        that cannot be divided into smaller meaningful parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example: 1. unladylike (3 morphemes)
    </p>
    <p>
        un – not
    </p>
    <p>
        lady – (well-behaved) female adult (human)
    </p>
    <p>
        like – having the characteristics of
    </p>
    <p>
        (None can be broken up any more)
    </p>
    <p>
        2. dogs – (2 morphemes)
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘dog’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘s’ – plural morpheme
    </p>
    <p>
        3. technique – (1 morpheme)
    </p>
    <p>
        2 syllables but 1 morpheme.
    </p>
    <h2>
        1.3 Types of Morphemes
    </h2>
    <p>
        In linguistics, we would further classify morphemes as either as
        <strong>
            phonemes
        </strong>
        (the smallest units of grammar recognizable by sound) or
        <strong>
            graphemes
        </strong>
        (the smallest units of written language). For our purposes, we will focus on graphemes.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two types of morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes. A "base" or "root" is a morpheme in a word that gives
        the word its principle meaning. An "affix" is a bound morpheme that occurs before or after a base. An affix that
        comes after a base is called a "suffix."

    <p>
        These are morphemes that can occur on their own without any morphemes necessarily attached to them. As such,
        <strong>
            free morphemes
        </strong>
        can stand by themselves as single, thoroughly independent words.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        i.
        <em>
            manage
        </em>
        as in management

        Free morphemes can further be subcategorized into

            Bound Morphemes
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bound morphemes in obvious contrast, only appear in combination with others, in most cases free morphemes. That is, these
        morphemes are bound in the very sense that they cannot stand alone and are thus necessarily attached to another form.

    <p>
        For example:
    </p>

        </a>
        that is added to a
        <a>
            word
        </a>
        to assign a particular

    <p>
        Some definitions of word:
    </p>
    <p>
        i. “A unit of expression which has universal intuitive recognition by native speaker, in
    </p>
    <p>
        both spoken and written language” (Crystal)
    </p>
    <p>
        ii. “A minimal free form” (Bloomfield)
    </p>
    <p>
        iii. “The smallest of linguistic unit which can occur on its own in speech or writing”
    </p>
    <p>
        (Richard &amp; Schmidt)
    </p>
    <p>
        iv. “A unit of meaning” (Finch)
    </p>
    <p>
        A word is the smallest free form in a language. A word may consist of only one morpheme but a single morpheme may not be
        a word. A word may include a root or stem. It may also include one or more affixes. Words can be combined to create
        other units of language.

    <h2>
        1.5 Some Types of Word Formation
    </h2>
    <p>
        In linguistics, word formation is the creation of a new word. Word formation is sometimes contrasted with semantic change,
        which is a change in the meaning of the word.

                    Compounding
                    <br/>
                </strong>
                Compounding forms a word out of two or more root morphemes. The words are called compounds or compound words. In Linguistics,
                compounds can be either native or borrowed. Native English roots are typically free morphemes, so that means
                native compounds are made out of independent words that can occur by themselves. Examples:
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <em>

                (composed of free root
                <em>
                    mail
                </em>
                and free root
                <em>
                    man
                </em>
                )
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <em>

                <em>

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some compounds have more than two component words. These are formed by successively combining words into compounds, e.g.
        <em>
            <strong>
                pick-up truck
            </strong>

        , formed from
        <strong>
            <em>
                pick-up
            </em>
            and
            <em>
                truck
            </em>
        </strong>
        , where the first component,
        <em>
            <strong>
                pick-up
            </strong>
        </em>
        is itself a compound formed from
        <em>
            pick
        </em>
        and
        <em>
            up.

                Derivation is the creation of words by modification of a root without the addition of other roots. Often the effect is a

                    Clipping
                </strong>
                <br/> Clipping is a type of abbreviation of a word in which one part is 'clipped' off the rest, and the remaining
                word now means essentially the same thing as what the whole word means or meant.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example:

                is a fairly modern clipping of an earlier compound
                <em>

                </strong>
                <br/> Acronyms are formed by taking the initial letters of a phrase and making a word out of it. Acronyms provide
                a way of turning a phrase into a word. The classical acronym is also pronounced as a word.

    <h2>
        1.6 Phrase
    </h2>
    <p>
        In grammar a phrase is a group of various words functioning as a single unit in the syntax of a sentence. A phrase can be
        simple (one word) or complex (a group of words)
    </p>
    <p>
        Eg: the store at the end of the street….. (a noun phrase)
    </p>
    <p>
        Most phrases have a central word defining the type of phrase. This word is called the head of the phrase. Phrases may be
        classified by the type of head:
    </p>

        1.7 Clause
    </h2>
    <p>
        A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate but cannot always be considered as a full grammatical
        sentence. Clauses can be either independent clauses (also called main clauses) or dependent clauses (also called
        subordinate clauses)
    </p>
    <p>
        Clause contrasts with sentence. Except in the case of a whole sentence, which is technically said to be also a clause, a
        clause is always smaller than the sentence that contains it.
        <br/>
        <br/> Clause also contrasts with
        <a>
            phrase
        </a>
        . Clauses contain phrases. Clauses are bigger than the simple phrases they contain. The crucial characteristic of a clause,
        which is lacking from a phrase, is that a clause normally has its own verb and all or many of the other basic ingredients
        of a whole sentence.

    <h2>
        1.8 Sentences
    </h2>
    <p>
        A sentence is a group of words that are put together to mean something. A sentence is the basic unit of language which expresses
        a complete thought. A complete sentence has at least a subject and a main verb to state (declare) a complete thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        The five main parts of a sentence are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Subject
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

        1.8.1 Types of Sentences
    </h3>
    <p>
        1.
        <strong>
            Simple Sentence
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A simple sentence has the most basic elements that make it a sentence: a subject, a verb, and a completed thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples
    </p>
    <p>
        a. Joe waited for the train.
        <br/> "Joe" = subject, "waited" = verb
    </p>
    <p>
        b. The train was late.
        <br/> "The train" = subject, "was" = verb
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of compound subjects, compound verbs, prepositional phrases (such as "at the bus station"), and other elements help
        lengthen simple sentences, but simple sentences often are short.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            2. Compound Sentence
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A compound sentence refers to a sentence made up of two independent clauses (or complete sentences) connected to one another
        with a coordinating conjunction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples
    </p>
    <p>
        a. Joe waited for the train,
        <strong>
            but
        </strong>
        the train was late.
        <br/> b. Mary and Samantha left on the bus before I arrived,
        <strong>
            so
        </strong>
        I did not see them at the bus
    </p>
    <p>
        station.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            3. Complex sentence
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses connected to it. A dependent clause
        is similar to an independent clause, or complete sentence, but it lacks one of the elements that would make it a
        complete sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples
    </p>
    <p>
        a.
        <em>
            When he came
        </em>
        I had left.
    </p>
    <p>
        b. I could not go to the stadium
        <em>
            because it was raining
        </em>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            4. Compound Complex
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A compound-complex sentence is comprised of at least two independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples
    </p>
    <p>
        a. Although I like to go camping, I haven't had the time to go lately, and I haven't found anyone to go with.
    </p>
    <p>
        (independent clause: "I haven't had the time to go lately")
    </p>
    <p>
        (independent clause: "I haven't found anyone to go with")
    </p>
    <p>
        (dependent clause: "Although I like to go camping... ")
    </p>
    <p>
        b. We decided that the movie was too violent, but our children, who like to watch scary movies, thought that we were wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
        (independent clause: "We decided that the movie was too violent")
    </p>
    <p>
        (independent clause: "(but) our children thought that we were wrong")
    </p>
    <p>
        (dependent clause: who like to watch scary movies)
    </p>
    <p>
        (Note: Compound-complex sentences are very common in English, but one mistake that students often make is to try to write
        them without having mastered the
        <a>
            simple sentences
        </a>
        ,
        <a>
            compound sentences
        </a>
        , and

    <h2>
        1.9 Paragraph
    </h2>
    <p>
        A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often
        made up of many sentences. It is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or
        idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again; this makes
        telling when one paragraph ends and another begins easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paragraphs contain a topic sentence. This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.
    </p>
    <p>
        A basic paragraph structure usually consists of these elements: the topic sentence, three supporting sentences, and a concluding
        sentence
